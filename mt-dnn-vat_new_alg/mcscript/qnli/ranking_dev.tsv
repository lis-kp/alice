First , we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures , deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room .

I thought about ignoring it , but I had an early shift at the diner the next morning and my only pair of black pants were in the laundry load . I went down the steep stairs to the basement where the laundry room sat , out of the way . I opened the washer and sighed as I looked inside . I grabbed an armful of the clothes from the washer and tossed them into the dryer , than repeated the process until the washer was empty . Without much thought , I tossed in a dryer sheet and slammed the door . I checked the settings , adjusted a few , and heard the comforting hum of the dryer coming to life . Satisfied that I would be ready for work the next day , I returned up the stairs to my television show . Where were the pants?	in the laundry load	upstairs

15	0,1	0,1	I wanted to take a photograph of something natural . So I decided to go out side and see what I could take a picture of . After a while I saw a big green pine tree full of birds and squirrels running around . I took my camera out of the bag , turned it on , and made some adjustments so the light was just right for the photo . I made sure the whole tree came out , so I stood far back . I turned the flash off because it was in the daytime . I looked through the viewfinder on the camera to see how the photo will look and I made sure everything that I wanted to come out did come out . I waited for the right moment and clicked the button , SNAP ! The photo was perfect , it was just what I had imagined it would look like . I made sure to save it so that I can print it out later .

When I think I 'm either sick or just to make sure I 'm healthy I make a doctor appointment . When it 's 20 minutes before it 's time for my appointment , I leave my house to go . Once I get to the doctor office I find a place to park . I walk inside the doctor 's office and check in with the receptionist . Once they call my name I go straight to the scale to get weighed , I always hate this part . Then the nurse takes me to the room , takes my blood pressure and asks why I 'm there . I 'm only there to check my cholesterol since last time I had it checked it was high . The doctor then comes in to talk about my last results and says that we will check it again today and then call him back in 3 months if it 's high to talk about my options . After that is done I go to the check out window and pay my copay for my visit . Where do they get blood drawn?	at the doctor's office	at the dentist

I spent a lot of time learning the new songs . Finally it was Sunday and I was really nervous . I was n't sure I would know when to start playing or if I would remember the right keys . I was n't nervous anymore and just started playing . I really enjoyed myself . Afterwards everyone was telling me I did a good job and the Pastor asked if I would be interested filling in again if they needed someone . Who did they help out?	Themselves	The church
40	0,1	1,0	Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring . And then we are ready for our camping vacation . What do they put the drinks in?	Cooler	sleeping bag

45	0,1	1,0	When I cooked pasta last , I had a great experience . I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce .

After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes , we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat .

Pulling the bag out was heavy and difficult , but I finally got it up and out . I tied it tightly so nothing would come out and took it outside to the big trash can by the curb . The scented bags I had ordered online had a pleasing scent and helped mask the left over scent of the old garbage I had just taken out . I pulled open the top of the bag and shook it out to make it expand . I slid it down in the can and secured the ends tightly around the can to make sure it did n't slip down in the can . Putting the top on the can I put it back by the refrigerator , and thought about what I was going to make for supper . When did they get inside?	After they came home from work	After making supper

The poster came rolled up like a tube , and the first thing I did was gently unroll it , taking care to not damage any of the edges or corners . Once the poster was unrolled , I grabbed my roll of scotch tape . I decided the poster would look best on the wall next to my bed , so I held the poster to the wall . Once I was satisfied with the poster 's placement , I pulled off a piece of tape . I placed the piece of tape on the top center of the poster and then fastened it to the wall . I then pulled off a second piece of tape and stuck it the center area at the bottom of the poster .

Once I had read about how to properly take care of an animal , I had to go and buy the supplies necessary . When I was all ready , I went back to the shelter and asked to adopt the dog . After I received all of the proper paperwork , I jumped back in the car with my new friend and drove home . It was a great decision . When did the shelter have the animals?	always	never

She checked me in and said the hygienist would be with me shortly . The hygienist is the person you see first , who cleans your teeth with a scraper , flosses them , and sometimes treats them with a pasty substance called fluoride . He said I had one small cavity , which I normally do n't have but ate a lot of sweets the past six months . A cavity can be a little scary , since the dentist goes in with a drill . I was scared it would hurt , but the only thing I felt a little was when the dentist put a needle in my mouth and injected something called Novocaine . Afterwards , I talked funny for a little while , but had healthy and clean teeth again . What made their mouth go numb?

143	0,1	0,1	Last week , on a beautiful sunny afternoon , I decided to take my niece Kathy to the playground . We were lucky because there were other children about her age already playing on the swings and slides . Kathy is chatty and likes to make friends by asking kids if she can play with them . She soon began to speak to another little girl names Eva and they were soon taking turns pushing each other on the swing . The two friends then decided to get in line for the slide . Kathy went first because she is a little more daring and her friend . Eva had never been on the tallest slide at the playground before but when she saw Kathy go down without a problem , she felt brave too . After a while , Kathy and Eva got tired of climbing up the slide so they went off to the moneky bars . When it was time to go the new friends gave each other a hug and promised to see each other at the playground on the next sunny day . Where were Kathy and Eva hung by their knees?	swing set	monkey bars

156	0,1	1,0	I need to go grocery shopping this weekend so I am in the process of making a shopping list . I 'll look through my fridge , freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly ; coffee , stevia , mint tea bags , paper towels . I 'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant . When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price . I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store . I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for , I will put that on the other side of the paper . Once I have my list made , I 'll double check it and head out to go shopping . What did they check to see if they already had?	items that they use frequently	items that are not used regularly

I 'll look through my fridge , freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly ; coffee , stevia , mint tea bags , paper towels . I 'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant . When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price . I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store . I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for , I will put that on the other side of the paper . Once I have my list made , I 'll double check it and head out to go shopping . When did they figure out meals?	after heading out to go shopping	When the grocery store ads and coupons come in the mail.

165	0,1	1,0	I usually fold my clothes after I take them out of the dryer . Some people do not , as rumpled casual is OK to wear these days . Folding clothes makes them easier to store in the closet or in a chest of drawers . If you are going to iron the clothes later , they are less rumpled if you have folded them first . I put them in piles according to clothing type . The surface of a made bed is a good place to fold clothes . I smooth out my socks and put them in pairs , tucking them together at the tops so they stay together . First I lay the item on the bed , smooth the fabric so that the item is reasonably flat , then I fold it into one or two parts . Men 's boxer shorts can also be rolled into a sort of a tube shape or sausage . This is still folding them , as it minimizes the wrinkles . I fold T-shirt , after smoothing them out , by folding the sleeves in first , then folding the remaining garment in half and then in quarters . Pants can also be smoothed then rolled with a minimum of wrinkles when you take them out to wear them . I do n't fold a lot of other kinds of clothes , as my husband and I sleep in T-shirts and underwear . After I am done folding the clothes I put them away on a shelf in the closet or in drawers . What do they lay on the bed to fold?	clothing	iron

175	0,1	1,0	When I was ten my family renovated the kitchen of our house . It was so interesting to watch the builders work . They had many blue prints , that architects had drawn to detail what work had to be done . They also had new cabinets and floors tiles and appliances . They removed some walls while building out others , and laid a new tile floor . They installed all the new cabinets and ran the water pipes and electricity to put in all the new appliances we got . It took them a few weeks to do but when it was done our kitchen was newer and so beautiful . It had better windows and more lights and it was easy to get around and cook in it . Renovating a room can be fun and really give your house a new look . What did the builders want to make sure was correct?	The blueprint of the kitchen	the family

After the tub I sprayed the same solution into the toilet and scrubbed the toilet with the scrubbing brush . I then scrubbed the sink and the faucet until they were shining . Next I sprayed the mirror with Windex and cleaned that until it was as clear as could be . I used my swifter wet jet and sprayed the solution and scrubbed the floor until it was completely clean . Once one bathroom is done I do the exact same process to the second bathroom . What is scrubbed after a few minutes?	Tub	The oven

257	0,1	1,0	My dad is a great cook and one of the things he knows how to cook good is fish . Sometimes he buys the fish from the supermarket and sometimes he buys the fish from the fish market . When he buys it from the supermarket he buys it by the pound and it is usually already cut up into pieces and cleaned up . When he buys it from the fish market he has to clean it out more and take out the bones . Some of the fish he buys still has the head , fins and tail so he has to cut those parts out too . I like it better when he leaves the scales -LRB- skin -RRB- of the fish as it tastes really good . There are many different ways that he cooks the fish . Sometimes he will fry it in a pan or deep fry the fish and also put some bread crumbs on the fish before frying it . My favorite is when dad steams the fish a little bit and we eat it semi-raw like sushi . In the summer time dad will also throw some fish on the grill and barbeque it . My mom told me that eating fish is really good for you as it has a lot of essentials vitamins and oils and eating fish makes you live longer and is also god for your brain . He bakes the fish in what?	Pan	the backyard

283	0,1	0,1	The walk home in the rain had drenched our clothes . We were sopping wet as we ran into the house laughing . After grabbing towels and bathrobes in exchange for the soggy rags our clothes had become I carried the garments , sopping with water , into the laundry room to dry them in the clothes dryer . First I had to set the temperature of the dryer . A medium temperature seemed like the best idea there . Then I had to choose how long to dry them . Thirty minutes ? Sixty minutes ? With no clue how long it would take I set the timer dial to automatic , surely the dryer would know more about how much time it would take than I would . With everything attended to I closed the door , pressed the start button and we watched through the little circular window as the clothes tumbled around in the machine . After about forty five minutes the buzzer on the dryer sounded and the machine shut itself off . I opened the door to a gust of hot air and lavender scent . One by one I pulled the dry articles of clothing out of the appliance and we put our pants and shirts and socks all back on . A fun night in all , if I do say so myself . When did they shut the door to the dryer?	after drying	After the put the clothes in

298	0,1	1,0	This morning , I was on my way to work when I noticed that the fuel light was on on the dashboard of the car . I spotted a gas station and pulled in next to one of the pumps - making sure that I remembered to pull in with the fuel door on the car closest to the pump . Before opening my driver side door , I quickly grabbed my bank card and pushed the fuel door button that was located near the bottom of my seat . I looked at the pump and inserted my payment card in the payment slot and then selected the type of gas that my car uses . I then opened the fuel door , took the gas nozzle from the pump and inserted it into the gas tank . The handle had a jumping sensation as an indication that my tank was full and the job was finished . I removed the nozzle from the tank and placed it back on the pump , took my receipt , jumped in my car and headed off to work Where was the gas flowing?	Into the gas tank.	into the pump

Once I was sure that the entries in my check register are complete , I checked my balance again . If it does n’t match the statement , I look for outstanding transactions such as checks that have n’t cleared . Once I subtracted the outstanding checks , my account balanced , so I put my receipts in the envelope with my bank statement and filed it in my business files .

355	0,1	0,1	For my anniversary with my husband , I decided to cook him a very fancy and nice breakfast . One thing I had always wanted to do but never got to try was making fresh squeezed orange juice . I figured that our anniversary would be the perfect time to try this ! I got about ten oranges because I was n't sure how much I was going to need to make enough juice for both me and my husband . I got home and pulled my juicer out from underneath my sink . It was still in the box since it was a wedding gift I had never had a chance to use ! I was excited to try it . I began using the juicer to squeeze the juice out of my orange juice . To my luck , I only needed about five oranges to make enough juice for me and my husband so I saved the rest of the oranges for later . I brought my husband his breakfast with the orange juice , and he said that the juice was his favorite part ! When did they plug the juicer in?	after squeezing oranges	after removing it from the box

374	0,1	0,1	Me and my nephews went into the pool and started moving into it while we waited for their swimming instructor . First we did some freestyle , and after a few minutes it transformed into a funny " dog style " , just paddling with our arms and legs like dogs do when they swim . When the instructor came , he greeted the children . All of them stood on one edge of the pool when I swam to the side just to give all of them space to train . He made a circle with his arms and told the children to jump through it head first into the water , with arms stretching forward and touching each other . He made all children repeat the diving until he thought everyone got it decently right , since there was age variety among the 12 students , ages 5 to 15 . The diving practice took some 15 minutes . I told him I only knew butterfly stroke from Wikipedia so I would be more than happy to give it a try . He gave me some instructions about how to make the stroke better , and it took another 45 minutes to help the children practice theirs . After one hour had passed , we got out of the pool , the teacher said goodbye to everyone and we all gave him our payment for the hour of class . Who did he start teaching?	the instructor	all the children

390	0,1	0,1	Sometimes I let my cleaning get out of hand . I do n't like to cook . I try to do as little of it as possible and only refrigerate .  I do not have many dishes .  I am getting better about it . I found out that eggs are a really bad one to leave out . I left egg remnants out on the counter .

Unfortunately I I had been having a lot of issues with mice . My husband bought a few traps and set them up once , but would n't follow through with emptying them and resetting them , or figureing out how to stop from coming in in the first place . After I spent hours cleaning out nests I found inside my couches , I gave up and decided having a cat would be fare less work than dealing with this mess and hopefully might help with the mice issue .

What did they find at the humane society?	mice	A cat.

I decided to make a dress . When I got home , I opened the pattern and spread out all the pattern pages . Each page has patterns for different pieces of the dress in different sizes . They are all printed over each other . I looked on the instructions to work out which size I wanted to make the dress , and found which color of line I needed to cut along . I cut out all the pieces . There was a front and a back piece , a sleeve pattern , which I needed to cut two of , and a collar . Then I cut around the paper pattern and through the fabric to get the fabric pieces the right shape . Then I pinned the pieces together with the front of the fabric on the inside . I sewed along each edge with my sewing machine . Then I sewed the sleeve seam , and then sewed the sleeve to the dress . Finally I sewed the collar to the neckline of the dress . All of that was done with the inside of the fabric facing out , so the seams would end up on the inside when I turned it right-side out . So finally I turned it right side out , all the seams ended up on the inside , and I had a new dress to wear . Where did they buy the fabric?	Fabric store	Home

446	0,1	1,0	Last weekend , my friend and I worked in the garden . The weather was nice and sunny outside , so we decided it would be the perfect day to spend time outdoors in our backyard garden . Our garden has a lot of flowers in it , but we thought it would be fun to plant some vegetables as well . We went to the store and picked up some supplies that we would need , like a small shovel , a small watering can , and some vegetable seeds -LRB- including carrot seeds , tomato seeds , and cucumber seeds -RRB- . We then went to our backyard and started to dig small holes in the soil so that we would have space to plant our seeds . Then we filled the watering can and watered each small mound of soil that had seeds underneath . All in all , working in the garden was a great way to spend the afternoon . What did they drop into the small holes?	seeds	trash

482	0,1	0,1	One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis . When I play tennis , a friend and I go to a special place called a court , which is made just for playing tennis . The tennis court is a flat place with a net across the middle .  To play tennis , we hit a ball back and forth at each other using big net paddles called rackets .  If you do n't hit the ball back when it 's hit to you , or if your opponent hits it so it goes outside of the court , you score points .  When you score once , you get fifteen points . When you score again , you get another fifteen points , so you have 30 points . Score a third time , you get 10 points , giving you a total of 40 . When do they get 40 points	when the ball goes outside the court	the third time they score

I could n't book online , but I made a note to go in on Sunday . I paid for my ticket without hassle . Once everyone had their tickets , a guide met us and led the group through the museum . I saw lots of exhibits : paintings , sculptures , pottery , and more . There was so much to see in the museum . Even if I 'd stayed all day , there was no way I could have seen all of it . At the end of my trip , I went to the souvenir store and bought myself a few trinkets . It was great ! What day was the visit to the museum?	Sunday	Monday

519	0,1	1,0	The other day I noticed that I was low on gas and had to fuel up my car . I pulled into the gas station with the pump on my driver 's side since that 's where my tank fills and turned off the car . The gas station I went to uses points that I earned at the grocery store so I entered my loyalty number and had 27 cents off a gallon which was great ! I swiped my debit card to pay and I popped the fuel door with a level inside my door and unscrewed the gas cap . I squeezed the handle and let the gas fill the tank until it automatically stopped because it was full . I carefully removed the nozzle from the fuel tank , replaced it on the pump and screwed the gas cap back on tightly and closed the fuel door . When I started my car to reset the trip meter and made note so I could see how many miles my car got per gallon since the last fill . Where did they put the nozzle?	in the fuel tank	in a gas can

Once we were in a good quiet spot on the lake , my dad took out our fishing poles and some worms for fishing bait . He put a worm at the end of my fishing hook and then told me to cast my fishing line into the lake . Once my fishing line was in the lake I waited and waited , but it seemed like there were no fish that were falling for my bait . I began reeling it in to find a fish that was 12 inches long ! My dad and I took it home so that mom could cook it for dinner . Where do they feel a nibble?	as the line was being reeled in	At the bait end of the rod

625	0,1	1,0	I recently took a taxi when I was staying with a friend in Chicago . The city is very busy , and parking can be hard to find , so it is often easier to take a taxi to get to place to place . We had decided to go to dinner and see a play . We walked to a street where taxis often go past , and waved to show the driver that we wanted a ride . I told the driver the name and address of the Thai restaurant my friend and I had planned to go to . He was familiar with the location and we started to travel . On he way , the driver told us that he also enjoyed Thai food and recommended the green curry at that restaurant . As we were driving , I could see how much the cost of the trip would be as a screen displayed a slowly increasing cost . We got to our destination , and I paid the driver the fee on the screen along with a small tip . What did the people get in?	A taxi	Their car.

The city is very busy , and parking can be hard to find , so it is often easier to take a taxi to get to place to place . We had decided to go to dinner and see a play . We walked to a street where taxis often go past , and waved to show the driver that we wanted a ride . I told the driver the name and address of the Thai restaurant my friend and I had planned to go to . He was familiar with the location and we started to travel . On he way , the driver told us that he also enjoyed Thai food and recommended the green curry at that restaurant . As we were driving , I could see how much the cost of the trip would be as a screen displayed a slowly increasing cost . We got to our destination , and I paid the driver the fee on the screen along with a small tip . where was the driver?	In the front seat driving the taxi	At the restaurant.

667	0,1	0,1	When I was young , my family got a dog named Sunny . We picked him up when he was just 12 weeks old and still a puppy . We immediately began our training with him , first up was potty training . Once he did so , he was rewarded a treat for his good behavior . Overnight , he stayed in his crate which was made smaller . It is said if dogs have a confined space they will not go to the bathroom since it will soil their immediate surroundings . The next three commands we taught Sunny were to sit , shake , and stay . He was a quick learner . Treats helped immensely for training the dog to follow these commands . Who knew there would be a reward?	The cat	Sunny the dog.

I let them do this throughout the day because there is not point in trying to clean until they 're too tired to pull out any more toys . We go from room to room gathering all the toys . Then I make them decide where each thing should go . They have to remember which bin , closet , bedroom , cabinet , etc each toy came from . Then we place them all back as neatly as we can . Everything has a place . Once the toys are back in their appropriate places I give everyone a gold star . And maybe a cookie . Because I 've earned it . When did they say something?	The nieces and nephews were told to order cooffee.	The nieces and nephews need to tell where each thing should go.

I prepare about 6-8 bottles ahead of time and place in the refrigerator so the baby does n't have to wait long for food when hungry . I can control the temperature and it is safer than microwaving for the baby . After testing a drop or two of warmed formula on my wrist , to make sure it is n't too cold or hot , it is time to pick up the baby and feed them . I hold the baby in my arms as they longingly look into my eyes . After about fifteen minutes the baby is n't drinking anymore . I put them over my shoulder and rub their back in order for them to burp . I then prop them up in their baby seat so as not to choke .

759	0,1	1,0	I had adopted a new dog and realized he needed lots of training . I got a book about dog training and read it so that I could understand how to train my dog the right way . I went to the pet store and bought some of his favorite dog treats . I first trained him to respond to the command " sit " and " stay " by giving him a treat every time he obeyed the command . After a while , he started obeying the command even without getting a treat in return . Over the next few days , I trained my dog to respond to different commands by gradually working up to more complicated commands like lay down , fetch , and retrieve . Training my dog took lots of patience on my part , and lots of hard work from my dog , but it was worth it . Who did they take outside and begin a training session with?	Their new dog	A dog they'd had for a while

794	0,1	1,0	I always thought cooking is very easy until my mum told me to cook meat this fateful day . After washing the meat with clean water I lit the stove and put clean pot on it and I pour clean water inside . I cut some onion inside the empty pot add some other ingredient in the pot and pour the meat inside before adding salt . After like 15 minutes , I opened the pot , the meat has already been boiled when I tasted it I realized it now really so soft and good to eat but since I do n’t want my mum to punish me I only eat some just some part of the meat . I put frying pan on fire . Added some oil after some time when I realized the oil was very hot I decided to put the meat on fire . The colour of the meat changed to dark brown as it fries I really enjoyed looking at it been fried and the noise it was making . What did mum tell them to do to the meat?	Cook the meat.

The only thing I had to do was cook the meat . Once the saucepan was very hot , I put just enough meat in it to make a hearty hamburger . The meat started to sizzle as it cooked . After a few minutes , I knew it was time to flip it over and cook the other side . I used a spatula to flip it over . The side that was already cooked looked perfect ! After a few more minutes of sizzling , I knew that the second side was done as well and that my hamburger was ready to eat . Before I started eating , I made sure to turn off the stove .

I always begin by surveying my refrigerator and cabinets .  What food do I already have and what do I need ?  At this point I begin to make a written list to bring with . This week I also had a birthday party to shop for so extras like cake mix and a can of frosting went on my list . Once the list was done I headed to the store .  It 's a short drive , and once there I grabbed a cart and begin to head down the aisles .  After that on to dairy and dried goods , and even cleaning products . Finally it was off to the frozen aisles , I needed to get ice cream for the party ! With a full cart I went to the cash register , loaded all the food on the convener belt , and then paid for the groceries as a boy bagged everything .  Another Saturday 's chore was done ! In what order do they shop for their items?	ice cream, dairy and dried foods, cleaning products	dairy, dried good, cleaning, frozen

When I got to the church , my first thought was about how small the building was , but when I went inside I could see that it was much bigger than it appeared .  When the service started , I got a little nervous , because this church is different from the church I usually attend . I did not know the prayers , hymns , and did not know when to sit , kneel and stand . It did not matter .  People around me were very helpful , and I figured out that if I watched the people around the altar , I could figure out what I needed to do .  I loved all of the ceremony and the formality of the service . When it was over , I thanked my friend for inviting me . I hope to attend again soon . What was simple and beautiful?	the drive over	the church service

912	0,1	0,1	Today , I helped my mom empty the kitchen sink . The sink was full of a lot of dishes , so the first thing we did was made sure they were all clean . The clean dishes I helped her put away , and some dishes that still looked dirty we decided to wash again . The way we washed them was to rinse them all off first with warm water , then soap them up with a sponge . My mom did most of the washing , and after each dish was washed I would rinse and dry it . I like that part the best , because it is rewarding to see all the clean dishes in the cabinet that we worked so hard to empty out of the sink . The empty kitchen sink then had to be cleaned with soap and water too ! So we scrubbed it down , and finally we were done . What did they and their mom use to get tough stains out?	a towel	dish soap

993	0,1	0,1	My whole life I thought the only way to unclog a toilet was by using a plunger and it was disguising . What a terrible thing to have to do , grab this wooden stick with this rubber suction cup looking thing at the end of it that was already dirty with the toilet water from the last time someone used it . Then finally , one day an ex girlfriend tells me that if you pour bleach into a clogged toilet and let it sit for awhile that it will dissolve in there and somehow make the toilet flush able . Since then I do n't even have a plunger and any time I can I share the knowledge with others who do the same thing now and can not believe that it works . I do n't know how plungers even sell anymore . What was it that worked and how did they feel?	The oil and they feel terrible	Bleach and surprised

On one of these days , recently , I decided that I would be the one to cook dinner for them , figuring that they deserve a break after a whole day 's worth of hard work . First , I had to figure out a meal that I could prepare that everyone would like . After deciding , I prepared the teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove using soy sauce and brown sugar . Once the sauce was done , I added some chopped up chicken and mixed it well to make sure the chicken got an even coating of sauce . Separately from this , I cooked about 3 cups of rice in the rice cooker . Once they all got home from school and work , they were pleased to find that I had made dinner , and they all seemed to think it was delicious .

1019	0,1	1,0	My husband and I are going on a trip . We purchased our plane tickets online a few weeks ago and today is finally the day . A friend of ours drops us off at the airport near the sign that has our airline service on it . There we show the attendant our tickets in order to let the airline know that we have arrived at the airport for our flight . We hand over our larger suitcases that will be stored in the cargo area of the plane during the flight . My husband 's suitcase is a little heavy , so the attendant weighs it to make sure it 's not over the 50 lb limit that my airline requires . Once our bags were checked , the attendant put a tag on them indicated which flight they will be going on . After we have checked in , we take our carry on bags and tickets and head to the security station . When we arrived at the security station , we stood in a long line and show a TSA agent our drivers license . We placed the tub and our carry on luggage on a table that x-rays your luggage to make sure you are not carrying anything dangerous on the plane . We also had to go through a metal detector . Once we were done we headed to the gate where our plane would be leaving . What did they remove?	shoes	luggage

We did n't need a big yard , but wanted some privacy and wanted the neighborhood to not be too noisy . Our bank would loan us money to buy a house a certain price range . Then my wife contacted several real estate agents to find one we liked . After picking one the agent took us around to see the houses . We had our real estate agent make an offer and the owner of the house accepted our price . We were so happy to have bought such a lovely house - our new home . What had a price that could be afforded?	yard	One of the houses they liked.

Back at home I dug small holes into the dirt in my garden , placed a few seeds in each hole , and covered the holes with dirt . I then watered the garden , and made sure to water it every day .

It was held on a Friday night , so I put on my cutest skirt and a black shirt and fixed my makeup and hair . The party was in full swing when I arrived , and my friend Sam greeted me at the door . Most of the people were dancing already , but I was apprehensive because I 'm not the best dancer . I went to the kitchen and got myself a beer and sipped on it while watching everything . A guy I did n't know with blonde hair came up to me after a little bit and started to ask me about myself . I spent several hours dancing at the party and ended up having a bit too much to drink so I called an Uber to go home and had to come back for my car the next day .

1093	0,1	1,0	My first time at the new high end steak house downtown , maybe my expectations were set too high , even though this place was being compared to Ruth 's Chris . The wait staff was very pleasant and well mannered and it was a quiet ambient setting . I decided to order steak -LRB- I normally order fried chicken everywhere I go -RRB- I wanted it medium rare and made that very clear to the waiter , I saw him jot it down when I said it . I waited about 40 minutes which seemed strangely long given there was only 2 other couples in the restaurant one of which already had their food . I pick up my fork with my left hand and my knife with the other . I begin to cut into the steak and realize it 's taking more effort than I expected . I realized why ; it was because my steak was very well done , and dry . I figured I would at least taste it and give it a chance , I do n't like to complain . I called the waiter over and politely explained to him that I knew it was n't his fault , but the steak was not made to order . He offered to bring me another steak , but I sent the steak back and told him I 'd rather just have the fried chicken . What came out and looked delicious?	steak	the chicken filet

I decided to order steak -LRB- I normally order fried chicken everywhere I go -RRB- I wanted it medium rare and made that very clear to the waiter , I saw him jot it down when I said it . I waited about 40 minutes which seemed strangely long given there was only 2 other couples in the restaurant one of which already had their food . I pick up my fork with my left hand and my knife with the other . I begin to cut into the steak and realize it 's taking more effort than I expected . I realized why ; it was because my steak was very well done , and dry . I figured I would at least taste it and give it a chance , I do n't like to complain . I called the waiter over and politely explained to him that I knew it was n't his fault , but the steak was not made to order . He offered to bring me another steak , but I sent the steak back and told him I 'd rather just have the fried chicken . What is on the plate?	steak	chicken
1100	0,1	1,0	I wanted to make some extra money so that I could afford a nice vacation later in the year . So , even though I had a full-time job , I decided to get a part time job on the week-ends . I was very open to the type of work that I would be willing to do , but I thought that retail would give me the best opportunity to find week-end work . Then I made sure that my clothing was professional and pleasing . I answered ads in the newspapers , but I also started to drop into different stores to fill out an application and leave a copy of my resume . In all I went to about 35 different places and I got a couple of call backs for interviews . I decided to take the job that was close to where I lived so that I would n't have to spend so much time traveling . I started my new part-time job the very next week-end in a small women 's boutique . I really have enjoyed working there and now I have the extra cash that I needed .

1114	0,1	0,1	Every night , I 'll take my son Jimmy to bed . First I take him to the bathroom so that he can brush his teeth and wash his face . Then , I take his hand and lead him to bed , he usually is yawning by the time we get there . I usually read him a story that I let him pick out . The other night he picked out `` Where the Wild Things Are '' which is also his favorite book . After the story , I 'll kiss him goodnight and turn off the light , but usually Jimmy will ask me to turn his nightlight on , but not always as sometimes Jimmy likes to look out his window , but only when the moon is bright and the sky is not cloudy . I will tell him `` good night , '' one last time before I close his door and go to bed myself . What does he need to be in?	In the moon	bed
1115	0,1	1,0	Today was the start of Spring , so I decided it was time to get some cleaning done . The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat . I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place .  I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting . I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun . Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it .  After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner , I took a look around my flat to assess my work . My apartment was now clean and it felt great !

1119	0,1	1,0	A few years ago I went to New York City . It 's not easy to drive a car around the city , due to it being so busy and so many people living there . The main options for getting around are walking , taking the subway , bus , or taxi . We usually took the subway around , but decided to take a taxi from my hotel to see the Lion King on Broadway . I went out of the hotel and hailed a taxi by holding my hand up like you might see in the movies . A yellow taxi pulled up to stop , and I got inside . The driver did n't talk much , and drove a little quickly for my liking , but I got there much sooner than the other transportation options would have taken . I paid the driver the fare on the meter , plus a little tip , and went inside to enjoy the show . What did the driver start?	The taxi meter	The Lion King show

By pressing the correct numbers , I was able to reach the store manager who told me the store 's hours . So I drove safely , but quickly to the store to retrieve the DVD player , a nice card and gift bag for her birthday present . Then I put it all in the bag and drove to her house for her birthday dinner . I was relieved to be able to find the gift in time before the store closed . When did they learn the store was still open for another hour?	When the man called.	When the hours were printed in a newspaper.

We had to ask an employee for directions just to find the kids section ! The nice employee told us that the kids section would be right in front of us when we got to the second floor . My mom and I picked out a couple of great ones that we thought would look really nice . We then started looking at the shirts . It was harder to find nice shirts , but after some time , we were able to find five that we both liked a lot .

1179	0,1	0,1	The other day my car was running low on gas so I stopped at the gas station . I had to wait for a free pump before I could park my car to get the gas . Once I got my spot at the pump I turned my car off so as not to give off a spark while pumping my gas . Stepping out of the car I slide my debit card into the card slot and selected debit .

1197	0,1	0,1	Yesterday I went to the gardening store to buy some basil and mint . When I was there I saw a beautiful orchid on sale and decided to buy it as well . When I got home , I felt the soil of the basil and mint and felt it was a bit dry . So I poured some water from the tap into a glass and then slowly poured it into the two pots until they felt moist . Today I read the instructions for caring for the orchid carefully . It said that instead of using normal water , that I should actually use ice cubes . I pulled three ice cubes out of a tray in the freezer and carried them over to the plant in my hand . I then put a reminder in my smartphone 's calendar to tell me to put ice cubes in the pot one week later . When did they put the ice cubes around the edge of the pot?	yesterday	today

So I went to the hardware store and bought a plunger which is like a rubber suction cup on a wooden stick . Then I drove back home and I opened the toilet lid . I flushed it again after the water settled , just to make sure it was really clogged . and I pushed and pushed and pushed until the water went down a little more and then I could tell that the toilet paper was slowly unclogging from the toilet . I pushed down a little more just to be sure , then I flushed the toilet again . It flushed successfully and all of the water went down the toilet like it is supposed to .

We loaded up her truck with our equipment and got on the road .  We went into the changing rooms to put on our bibs , jackets , heavy socks and ski boots . Then we bought our lift tickets , attached them to the zippers on our jackets , and went over to the lift . We put our skis on and got on the lift to take it to one of the easier hills .  We wanted to start slowly before we went on the more difficult hills .  We stood side by side and pushed off . We laughed as we flew down the hill , knowing we were ready to tackle a bigger hill next and confident we 'd be on the black diamonds by the end of the day . Who positioned themselves on the hill?

1253	0,1	0,1	When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit . What type of hole was there?	A hole in the fabric.	A hole for the root ball.

1256	0,1	1,0	When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard .

1297	0,1	0,1	I looked at my alarm clock one night and the screen was blank , so I knew the batteries were probably dead . I picked up the alarm clock and turned it over , looking at the back and bottom for a place where the batteries go . On the bottom of the clock I saw what looked like a little rectangular door with a latch on one side . The little rectangular door came off the clock and underneath I saw two batteries . They said AA on them , so I knew they were double A. I went into the kitchen and found some double A batteries in a drawer . I took them back to the clock , and pulled the old batteries out of the clock . I checked inside the clock where the batteries had been and saw a picture of a battery in each spot where the batteries go . I lined up the bumpy end and flat end of each battery with the picture inside the clock when I put the new batteries in . Then I put the little door back on the clock the same way i took it off , by pushing in on the latch and this time pressing it down into place . What did they press the latch with?	battery	fingers

1331	0,1	1,0	I wanted to buy a fruit tree for my garden . Most fruit trees are very pretty when they have flowers on , and then in summer or fall they have fruit on too ! I was very excited . The garden shop had lots of different kinds of tree , apples , pears , plums and peaches . I decided I wanted a peach tree .

1339	0,1	1,0	When I was a kid I loved going down to the playground . I would beg my mom to take me down to the park where there was a little playground . We got into a routine where she would take me after school . I 'd rush home , quickly finish my homework , pour a drink and make a sandwich and after an hour I would be done . So then I 'd go grab my mom usually in the lounge or in her study and we would head off to the playground . We 'd throw a tennis ball to each other and sometimes we would take my dog with and let her run around crazily . I loved the pipe and the little obstacles , it made for a great time and I have so many fun memories about being at the playground and I will always remember it fondly . Who would they swing with?	With their mom	Father

1362	0,1	0,1	When I was in high school , I always needed the help of an alarm clock to wake me up in the morning . This would help me get all of my things ready for the day and get to school on time . One morning , though , the alarm clock did n't go off , and I ended up waking up and going to school much later than usual . After school that day , I realized that the battery on the alarm clock was probably dead , so I walked to a convenience store close to my school to pick up some batteries . I had my mom pick me up from the store , and after getting home , I changed the batteries on the alarm clock . That night , I set my usual alarm , and sure enough , it went off right on time the next morning . Unlike the day before , I was able to get all of my things ready and be at school right on time . What did they know would work the next morning?	not setting the alarm	Their alarm clock

1372	0,1	1,0	The weather was nice today , warm and sunny with no sign of rain , so my best friend and I decided to have a picnic . First , we thought about a good location , and decided to go to a state park not very far away . The park has lots of picnic tables , plus trails for hiking and other activities we could do after eating . We put some ice in the bottom of the cooler . After that , we put in some bottled water , then potato salad and fruit , stored in their own sturdy plastic containers . The sandwiches went on top , where they would n't get squished by the heavier items . We packed the cooler in the trunk of my car , along with some sunscreen and bug spray , and drove to the state park . While we ate our meal , we watched the wildlife nearby . Squirrels played in the tree , birds flew overhead , and a deer cautiously crept out of the woods to graze at the edge of the clearing . When we finished eating , we picked up all of the trash and put it into a bag . We carried the cooler and the trash back to the car and put it away before going hiking . What would become lighter once the ice was out?	the cooler	The picnic table

1401	0,1	1,0	My sister has an appointment this morning , so I happily agreed to watch my one year old niece and 3 year old nephew so she could go . Before they arrived , I made sure that my outlets still had child covers on them so there would be no chance of either child getting hurt on the outlet . I also put baby gates across the stairs leading downstairs . I would never want them to tumble down . When my sister arrived , she gave me information on when they normally eat a snack and lunch and what time they usually take a nap . She also gave me a diaper bag with extra diapers , wipes , a change of clothes and a favorite toy . I was certainly going to do that . Our first task was building large colorful towers with duplo blocks that my niece loved to knock over and my nephew loved to rebuild . We listened to " The Wiggles " and danced and sang and then it was time for a potty break / diaper change and a snack . With both kids rubbing their eyes , it was very apparent that it was now nap time , right on schedule . After a nap and a lunch of small pieces of chicken and vegetables with mac and cheese , I heard a knock on the door and my sisters voice . How quickly had the time passed?	very quicky	not quickly

Our first task was building large colorful towers with duplo blocks that my niece loved to knock over and my nephew loved to rebuild . We listened to " The Wiggles " and danced and sang and then it was time for a potty break / diaper change and a snack . With both kids rubbing their eyes , it was very apparent that it was now nap time , right on schedule . After a nap and a lunch of small pieces of chicken and vegetables with mac and cheese , I heard a knock on the door and my sisters voice . What had passed too quickly?	time	orders

Before they arrived , I made sure that my outlets still had child covers on them so there would be no chance of either child getting hurt on the outlet . I also put baby gates across the stairs leading downstairs . I would never want them to tumble down .

First , I decided what meals I would make during the week and thought about all of the ingredients I would need to prepare the meals .

I wrote down anything that was almost gone or completely gone . I then wrote down any household items that I needed , like paper towels and laundry soap .

I knew I had to change the batteries . This is important as I need it to wake me up in time for work .  I lifted the plastic cover and checked what batteries it required : two AA-sized batteries . These are quite common , and I got them from the kitchen drawer . I removed the old batteries by lifting them up , then I placed the new batteries in the same position , making sure the plus-side of the batteries -LRB- the little tip -RRB- were in the right direction , as it is usually engraved on the plastic .  I adjusted the time with the help of my watch , and went to bed , knowing I would be woken up by my alarm at the right time the next morning . When did they grab the clock?

1441	0,1	1,0	When I was a young child we played football every Thanksgiving with the family . It was so much fun . First we would arrive at my grandparents ' house . Then , while the food was being cooked we would go outside in the back yard and split up into teams . It was a lot of fun . We played flag football , which means that you grab the flag off someone instead of tackling them . We played this way because there were a lot of younger kids like me playing that did not need to get hurt playing traditional football . After the game was over we would all go inside and eat Thanksgiving dinner . This is a very special memory to me and all of my other family members . Who was the first relative mentioned?	Their grandparents.	the cousins

1443	0,1	1,0	Yesterday I chopped up vegetables for a salad . I removed all of the ingredients that I needed for my salad from the fridge . This included lettuce , tomato , cucumber , onion , broccoli , and carrot . I placed each vegetable on the cutting board and began to cut them with a large knife , making sure to remove peels and stems that were inedible . I threw these parts away in the garbage . I made sure to cut the vegetables into small , bite-sized pieces and slices , especially the larger vegetables like broccoli and lettuce . As I finished cutting each vegetable , I put it into a large bowl . Once all of the vegetables were chopped up , I put my cutting board and knife into the sink to be washed later .

My friend had just left to go run some errands when I noticed that it smelled like Savannah 's diaper needed to be changed . I pulled out her changing mat , gloves , and some wipes . I unfolded the changing mat on the ground , put on some gloves , and gently placed the baby on the changing mat . I rolled the dirty diaper into itself and placed it in the diaper disposal can right next to me . I used some wipes to clean the baby off , then took a new diaper out of her diaper container .

I made sure the diaper was secure so there would n't be any leaking , and then I rebuttoned the baby 's onesie . Whose onesie did they unbutton?	The friend	Savannah

1457	0,1	0,1	Yesterday night we went out to dinner at an Indian restaurant . It was a casual dining restaurant with decent tables and chairs . We arrived at the restaurant at 8 PM . We looked at the menu briefly and ordered appetizers first . We ordered Vegetable Pakora and Paneer Pakora . This gave us some time to decide on the main course . We pondered whether we should order the Vegetable Biryani or not for a few minutes . We decided to skip it after looking at other tables and seeing portions were big . The food was delicious and we decided to skip dessert since it was so filling . We will come back another time to try out other dishes and dessert too . We enjoyed the night out . What did they order along with the main course and Butter Naan?	rice	Vegetable Pakora and Paneer Pakora.

We measured the size of the room to get the area and we ordered the flooring at the lumber yard . The cartons of flooring were heavy . We also needed to purchase rolls of underlay . We tore the carpet up and threw it out . Then we lay down the underlay mats . After just laying down the underlay , we took a short break . Then it was time to put down the laminate . It was hard to lock the pieces together , but it came out nicely . We were proud of the hard work we did . What was it that made them sweat a lot?	knocking down a wall	Heavy cartons and laying down the underlay

I got out my bread board and found my large chef knife in the knife rack . I took the oranges to the sink and washed all the oranges . I then began to cut all of the oranges in half .

1486	0,1	0,1	This morning I wanted to make myself a healthy breakfast and decided that since I had just gone grocery shopping the day before , I should make use of all the healthy and delicious vegetables that I had bought . I set out all the ingredients that I needed , which I pulled from out fridge . I put them on the kitchen counter along with the kitchen tools and cutlery I would be using to prepare it . I wanted tomatoes and lettuce as the main ingredients so I set to work chopping them up and adding them to a relatively large salad bowl . I then wanted some spice so I added a large serving of pepper dressing onto the vegetables I had put in the bowl , and then I mixed it all together and served myself my scrumptious home made salad . What ended up being included in the salad?	kitchen tools	Lettuce and tomatoes.

1494	0,1	1,0	After work yesterday , I remembered that I needed to get gas before I could drive home . I pulled up to the station near the ramp where I get on the highway , and stopped next to the only available pump . I like this station because it has the cheapest gas in town , and yesterday it was $ 2.75 / gallon . I did n't have any cash on me , which is good because I would have wanted to use my credit card anyway . Then I chose regular unleaded gas , and opened my gas tank . I started pumping , and locked the handle in place so I did n't have to hold it while the tank filled . It automatically filled up , and then I replaced the pump in the machine . I like to get a receipt because it helps me keep track of how often I need gas , so I pressed YES when the machine asked me if I wanted one . When did they get back in the car?	After the pump was replaced in the machine.	When they left the restaurant.

I spoke with my dad and sister and my dad told me that in order to not get ripped off , you have to constantly check the prices of airfare and keep checking often . He said that prices tend to be cheaper on certain days of the week and you should clear your search history to avoid the airlines keeping the prices high . This took a lot of work and required me looking around at different airlines for the perfect fight . While this process was somewhat long and difficult , I felt great that I was able to get a good deal and save a lot of money . Unfortunately , I also had to pick seats and pay more and also pay more for bags . When did they review the prices?	while looking for a flight	after booking a flight

My mom took me inside , and when they called my name , we went back to a room where a dental assistant greeted us and cleaned my teeth before doing the actual extraction of my front two teeth . I was scared . When she attempted to put the injection around my gums , as a knee-jerk reaction , I bit her finger . She was really unpleasant about it . So instead of attempting to numb the area again , she just pulled out my teeth with a pair of pliers while I screamed . She had me then bite on some thick gauze and lay back in the chair . I was given my teeth in a small , pink treasure chest and sent on my way . I do n't like going to the dentist anymore . What did the person see?	dentist	teacher

1556	0,1	0,1	Before I go grocery shopping I make a list . I actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know I am out or low on something . I try to only go once a week unless there is something I really need for a specific meal . I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . Good to have a little bit of patience . I try to remember to bring my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting plastic bags . What does the person not like to jump?	aisles	checkout lines

They are known for their variety of steaks cooked to order and a very creative menu of side dishes . I also ordered a side of steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes . I drank water with dinner because I was driving last night . When my steak arrived I eagerly cut into it expecting it to be cooked exactly as I had ordered .

1583	0,1	1,0	The Long Awaited Bath I had been outside working in my garden all day . It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt , I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good . I wanted to get everything done in one day so I had worked very hard for a very long time . However , when I went inside to clean up , I realized from an automated message in my voice mail that the water had been shut off temporarily for emergency repairs , it would be on again in a few hours . I was frustrated , but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made myself a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat . I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked . I ran myself a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in it . I got in and found it very relaxing . I was so glad to finally take a bath , get cleaned up , and relax after a long , hard , productive day .

Sometimes there are more forms , but you will always have a W-2 . These forms show the amount of money you have earned and the amount of money you have paid in taxes . Sometimes people pay too much , and sometimes people pay too little . Doing taxes corrects for that . To figure out if you paid too much , not enough , or just the right amount I like to use computer software . It is very easy . The computer screen will ask a series of questions and tell you which numbered box on your form you can find that answer . If you paid too little , you will have to pay the government money , but usually people have paid too much and get money back . When does the computer calculate whether they paid enough?

First thing was to see what bus I needed . I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all . When did they pull up the bus schedules for their city?	Before going to the library	at the library

1654	0,1	0,1	I cooked dinner for myself last night . It was a simple affair of packaged ramen , with some additional ingredients thrown in . First , I boiled a bit more than two cups of water , which was slightly above what the package called for . I also added a handful of frozen mixed vegetables . I then cracked open three eggs into a bowl , and sliced four hot dogs into diagonal slices . Once the water was boiling I added both the block of dried ramen and the seasoning packets from the package . I also added the sliced hot dogs , as well as two slices of Swiss cheese to give the broth more flavoring and creaminess . Finally , I poured the three eggs from the bowl into the pot and let it boil for an additional minute and a half before taking it off the heat . That way the egg whites would firm up , but the yolk would remain runny . What did they season the water with?	Hot dogs.	Seasoning packets.

1676	0,1	0,1	I placed the laundry basket of freshly washed clothes on the folding table in the laundry room and started in . I first sorted out types of clothes from the basket - shirts in one pile , pants in another , and socks and underwear in another . I took a t-shirt out of the pile , flipped it over so that the back of the shirt was facing me and laid it out flat on the table . I then folded the right arm straight down so that the arm of the shirt faced the middle , then the left side so that it looked like the arms were crossed on the shirt . I picked it up , flipped it back over and the shirt was perfectly folded ! Boy this task was getting boring - I decided to do this while watching TV and moved the basket , and piles of clothing that were already folded to a nice comfy big chair , turned the TV on , found a favorite program and plopped down to continue the task of folding clothes . Ahhh much better ! Then came a pair of pants which I held up in front of me , folding the side-seems of the legs so that they met together at the legs . I put the pants in a stack of the same type of clothing that had already been folded and continued getting all those clothes folded and ready to put away . Next came socks , find the mate to the sock needing to be folded , put them together and take one sock , folding the top over the other like you are making a cuff after you have put it on your foot , keep pushing the other sock in so that it looks like you have a small ball when you are done . Yaaay , socks are all done , now it 's underwear next ! I pulled a pair of panties out of the basket , laid it out flat and then folded each side so that it met in the middle , then the bottom so that it to met in the middle then flipped it over , and started a pile of freshly folded underthings . For things like bras , I folded the cups together , the back so that it fit inside the cup , and the straps down . Soon with the help of glancing at the favorite TV program , the basket was empty , and laundry all folded - yippeeee ! What was being folded?	legs	freshly washed clothes

I put the pants in a stack of the same type of clothing that had already been folded and continued getting all those clothes folded and ready to put away . Next came socks , find the mate to the sock needing to be folded , put them together and take one sock , folding the top over the other like you are making a cuff after you have put it on your foot , keep pushing the other sock in so that it looks like you have a small ball when you are done . Yaaay , socks are all done , now it 's underwear next ! I pulled a pair of panties out of the basket , laid it out flat and then folded each side so that it met in the middle , then the bottom so that it to met in the middle then flipped it over , and started a pile of freshly folded underthings . For things like bras , I folded the cups together , the back so that it fit inside the cup , and the straps down . Soon with the help of glancing at the favorite TV program , the basket was empty , and laundry all folded - yippeeee ! What was the folding part of?	Getting ready for a banquet.	doing the laundry

I went over to their house and asked where they keep the dog treats . We started with some basic commands , like " sit " and " stay . " When he did the right thing , we gave him a treat . To train him to stay , we took him outside , where he likes to run around . We told him to sit , and gave him a treat , then started to toss a ball around . We told the dog to stay , because we knew he 'd be full of energy and would try to catch the ball that we were tossing . He was n't perfect this first time , but after several weeks , he was perfectly trained ! When did the person give the dog a treat?	when he got to his house	after the dog sat

To train him to stay , we took him outside , where he likes to run around . We told him to sit , and gave him a treat , then started to toss a ball around . We told the dog to stay , because we knew he 'd be full of energy and would try to catch the ball that we were tossing . He was n't perfect this first time , but after several weeks , he was perfectly trained ! What did they make sure the dog did after the command?	Followed the command.	ran around

1826	0,1	0,1	I went to my brother 's wedding , the only time I was ever a groomsman . It was great , because I felt special . I did n't feel as special on the other weddings .  But for the other two siblings , I was an usher , which I really hated anyway . I as an usher for this wedding too , which is a really dumb thing . It was n't my wedding , but it was uncomfortable for me and i 'm sure it was for the other people too .  I was n't on the stage but was in the seat for the other ones . Considering I do n't get an invite for other weddings , I am glad that I at least got into the other ones . This one the only way I was singled out was that I did n't get a golf gift , which I suppose is a traddition ? What did they feel good on?	Usher	Being a groomsman.

1835	0,1	0,1	August is back to school time in my city , and back to school means back to school shopping . My daughter and I went through all of her clothes and shoes to see what she has that she can use this year , and what we need to give away . Once we knew what she could use , we made a list of what she needed ( and some things she wanted ) .  Based on the list of needs and want , we decided which stores we would visit .  Once we arrived at the first store , we browsed through the clothes on the racks looking for the styles and sizes that would best suit my daughter . She picked a few things , and we headed for the dressing room . She tried on each of the items she had selected , and if she liked the item , we checked the price tag .  If the item was too expensive , we put it in the reject pile . After she tried on everything we had taken into the dressing room , we took our purchase pile to the customer service counter to pay for our items . Then we moved on to the next store , and repeated the process until we had found everything on our list . They set off in their car to go where?	School	Clothes shopping

I then looked into the compartment to see which end of the battery should go in first . I slid a battery - side first into the right slot , and + side first into the left slot .

1943	0,1	0,1	I was hungry for lunch so I decided to make a sandwich . I went to the refrigerator and got the bread , cheese , mayonnaise , mustard , and meat to make it . Since I like my bread toasted , I put it in the toaster . Next up I layer the bottom piece of bread with cheese and meat . But wait , my sandwich looks like its missing something . Now I know its missing some color . So I wash out some lettuce and tomatoes and onions for my sandwich . Once done , I now layer the vegetables on my sandwich and close it with the top piece . Oh wait I need a few more things to make my lunch complete . Back to the refrigerator I go and grab the peppers and over to the pantry for potato chips . I guess I will need a drink to go with this lunch so I grab a water bottle . When do potato chips go with their sandwich?	before the sandwich is eaten	after the sandwich is put together

It was interesting to have five people in a small space even though I know many families do that regularly . They bought a house that was pretty close to the rental one , which is funny because the other house was about the same distance away . It was n't as big enough for the dog . The old place I actually preferred , since it was a bit bigger . Also I parked my car in front of the new one , and someone clipped it and knocked off part of a panel . That was annoying . I never fixed it . What kind of place was it?	a rental house	bank

1985	0,1	1,0	I recently needed to find a new flat , so I started by familiarizing myself with websites that have local rental listings . Before searching these sites , I thought about what I could afford and what amenities I wanted . I considered the number of bedrooms and I decided on two so that I would have a home office as well as someplace for guests to stay when they visit from out of town . I did n't want to spend too much money on monthly rent , so I decided that I would n't mind living on the second floor and that I could go without a dishwasher . It seemed like everything near the city was too expensive . I began to be concerned when I had n't found a suitable place to live after a few weeks of looking . Persistence paid off when I found a two bedroom apartment that was a short drive to the city . Since it was not yet rented , I set up a time to look at the place and I ended up loving it . So , I signed the lease , paid a security deposit , the first month of rent , and moved into the flat . They inquired about what?	two bedroom apartments	a dishwasher

1987	0,1	0,1	After living in my apartment for 7 years , I decided it was time to move . Prior to moving , I had to secure a rental truck so I could be assured that I could move my furniture to my new apartment . On moving , my son and I got up early and got the rental truck .  We devised a system where he would stay in the truck and I would bring out all the small furniture items and he would stack them . When we finished that task , we moved on to the larger items . These items took both of us to load onto the truck .  My son is over six feet and I 'm really short , so we had a lot of trouble getting the mattress out of the door and onto the truck ! We finished moving all the furniture in record time , returned the truck and sat down for some cold lemonade . What was the mattress in terms of moving?	tiny item	the people had trouble getting it through the door
