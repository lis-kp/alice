0	0,1	1,0	Omelettes make a great breakfast , and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook . First , I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl . I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories . I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor . I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan . I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I do n't want them to stick . As this occurs , I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture . Really , almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette . I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle . It is then ready to serve ! What are the eggs beaten with sometimes?	whisk	frying pan

9	0,1	1,0	I was the first person up in my house on Saturday morning , so it was up to me to make the coffee . I took a container of French vanilla from the pantry along with a clean filter . I measured 2 tablespoons of coffee into the filter .  I removed the filter holder from my coffee machine and put the clean filter with the french vanilla coffee into it , relishing the aroma .  Then I took the glass carafe from the machine and filled it with cold water . I poured the water into the area above the filter and turned the machine on . I could hear the water heating and within a few minutes hot water was running down over the coffee grounds and then dripping into the carafe .  When all the water had run over the beans , I poured some into my favorite mug and added a little bit of cream and some sugar . What did they do with the holder?	removed it from the coffee machine	They removed the filter holder from the pantry and put the clean filter with the french vanilla coffee into it.

14	0,1	1,0	My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport .  But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours .  It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go .  Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops .  The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas . How long were they sitting on a airplane?	more than four hours	two hours

17	0,1	1,0	I had to get up this morning and get the coffee ready . While it was waiting , I fed the cat , and made sure she was n't near the front door , because I did n't want to let her out . The paper usually came before I woke up anyway , so I did n't have any trouble finding it outside . I saw a light-colored plastic bag , which is usually what they came in , and could see the newspaper through the bag . I had to wear sunglasses just to go out for about 30 seconds , because I did n't think my eyes would be able to take it . I was glad when I took the paper out of the bag as I walked inside . It was much drier than the one I had gotten the day before ! How sunny was the day?	sunny enough to require sunglasses	very cloudy

37	0,1	0,1	I enjoy making coffee so it 's a fairly complex process but it is easy to make coffee . I already have a coffee machine that makes espresso - the dark black coffee - and also steams and froths milk , which is a separate attachment . To prepare for making my coffee , I fill a coffee cup half full of milk . I usually grind two grinders full of beans at once and keep the ground coffee in an airtight container , so I do n't have to grind it every time . I take a couple tablespoons of the grinds and put them in the basket that then is inserted into the coffee maker . Next I turn on the coffee maker and when it indicates it 's ready , place the mug of milk under the attachment and let it froth the milk until it is hot - usually one or two minutes . Finally , I press the button to have hot water run through the coffee grinds , running the coffee into the mug of frothed milk then turn off the coffee machine and enjoy . When did they take whole beans to grind them?	after frothing the milk.	before making coffee

Usually I start by washing knives , so I do n't accidentally cut myself on them , but today there were n't any dirty , so I started with the silverware . I washed all the silverware , then rinsed it . Then I let all the plates soak in the sink while I dried the silverware . I washed the plates , rinsed them , and put in the glasses to soak . You do n't have to let everything soak for a few minutes , but it makes things easier to wash . I do those last because they 're usually the dirtiest and greasiest , and I do n't like to wash dishes in dirty water . After I rinsed and dried them , I drained the sink and rinsed it out . Then I wiped down the stovetop . No matter how careful you are cooking , you always spill something . I wiped the counters next . They 're wood , so I made sure they were dry when I was done , otherwise they can stain . Then I rolled up the rug , took it outside , and gave it a good shake to knock off any dirt on it . Before I put the rug back , I swept the floor , and then I was done . It was n't very fun , but it 's nice having a clean kitchen , even if it never lasts very long . What did they wash first?	glasses	the silverware

119	0,1	1,0	I flew from Amsterdam to New York City last week . I had purchased and reserved my ticket a week in advance . I left the hostel I was staying and arrived at Schiphol Airport at about 21:00 . I went to and found my seat , located on the left-hand side near the middle of the plane . I placed some of my hand luggage in an overhead compartment and sat down next to another passenger who was seated to my right . I watched the rest of remaining passengers who were heading to their seats . About 20 minutes later , once everyone was seated and were given basic safety instructions by the flight attendants , the pilot announced that the we were now going to take off for New York . It was a evening flight , so I slept on and off for a little while , then began watching an in-flight movie . After about 3 hours , we were served a light dinner of a chicken entree , bread , and juice . The food was surprisingly tasty and I enjoyed it . After finishing my meal , I relaxed and occasionally looked out the window at the night sky , as well as occasionally chatting with the person sitting next to me . The plane touched down shortly afterwards , and we safely landed in New York . When had the engines started?	Before takeoff.	3 hours later

What did they sweep with?	a broom and dustpan	the floor
147	0,1	1,0	The kitchen is very messy . I gathered up my broom and my dustpan , as well as my mop and bucket for water and cleaning supplies . I added water to the bucket and I added a cap full of cleaner to the water . But before mopping , I had to sweep the floor with the broom and the dustpan . I gathered all the dust and dirt from the floor and put it into the trash can . I then washed all the dishes in the sink , and wiped down the counters with a wet wash cloth . I put the mop into the bucket with the hot soapy water and I started to run the mop along the floor , making sure I covered every area of the kitchen . I then left the room to make sure the floor could dry so nobody slipped and falls . Now the kitchen is clean !

191	0,1	1,0	This morning , like any other morning , I woke up still tired . Coffee is something I require daily to function . Up until last year , I used a regular coffee pot , and would brew about six cups , and drink most of it . It has become a hobby of mine to collect different coffee and tea flavors , and try something new . Today , I felt like having one of my fancier kinds of coffee . This kind is a Gevalia mocha latte . I added some water to my Keurig machine , and within a minute it was ready to brew . I put the k-cup into the slot on the machine , and added the chocolate packet to an empty coffee mug . Today I used my favorite teal coffee cup with birds and flowers on it . The machine sputtered out a delicious cup of coffee , I stirred the chocolate powder into the coffee until it was blended . I grabbed a chair at my kitchen table , drank my delicious high-calorie breakfast , and was ready to take on the day . What does a Keurig brew?	Coffee	beer

197	0,1	0,1	One of my favorite daily rituals involves making coffee . I do it every single day at least once , and sometime twice . I am not sure if it is the flavor of the coffee or the smell and sound of the coffee that I enjoy the most . The very next thing I do is head to the kitchen to make coffee . I first choose my cup for the day . My favorite is an insulated stainless steel lidded cup that keeps the coffee burning hot . I then add coffee grinds to the coffee maker single serving basket . I also push the grinds down with a small juice cup , in hopes that it makes it stronger . I press start and the drip begins ! 5 minutes later , I have a cup of coffee in my cup . what does the cup get filled with?	grounds	coffee

205	0,1	0,1	In September 2012 , I rode and flew in an airplane on my way back home from my parents ' country of birth , the Philippines . I rode two different planes , but this one will be about the second one , the trip on the way back to the United States . I was in Narita International Airport and boarding my second flight . But like one would normally do , I waited in line , showed the boarding attendant my ticket and passport , and headed to the tunnel connecting the building and the plane . As I headed for my seat , I tried looking at the seat numbers on the compartments above them . I found mine , and opened the compartment to put my carry-on in . I sat down and tried to make myself comfortable . The flight attendant made some announcements , and we were set . I was seated by the window , as I always do . I love sitting by the window . I decided to open up a fresh set of earphones and browsed the media player in front of me , and watched Avengers . My viewing was interrupted when dinner was being served . I love airport food as well , for the most part . After eating , I finished the movie and fell asleep . For the rest of the flight , I saw clouds , sunshine , and other planes , and by nighttime , we landed in New York , at the JFK International airport . It was a great flight . The view is awe-inspiring when who is that high?	The flight attendant.	passengers

It was me and my girlfriend who needed to eat and we both wanted to eat somewhat healthy , while not going out to spend money and get food . As a result , we found eggs in the refrigerator and took out a few for each of us . We then cracked the eggs into a pan , making sure that the outer crust did not end up in the pan .

236	0,1	1,0	When I was a kid , my dad was a licensed pilot and he had a small plane . It seated 4 . He lived in a small town about 2 hours by car north of the larger town when we kids lived with our mom . We would go visit my dad every other weekend . His was smaller , though , and only seated 2 people . It was fun to fly in because I got to sit in front and see out the front and watch him work the controls . When we flew with my dad , my stepmother sat in the front seat and all three of us kids sat in the back seat . We were small , so we all fit . Then he would do the preflight checks . Some of these were outside the plane , but most of them were done from the inside . He would radio the tower and ask for permission to take off . This was always very exciting . The takeoff was a little scary because in a plane that small you could really feel the wind and the forces of the take off . Sadly , I had bad motion sickness , and my main memory of the landings is throwing up down the back of my dad 's neck . Where was the luggage?	on the plane	In the car

248	0,1	0,1	I was excited to be going to Cancun in two weeks . I brought my tickets a few months before , and when the day arrived , I simply printed out the ticket from my computer . I brought my two suitcases filled with clothes and necessities , along with my visa and other important travel documents . Once I got to the airport , I passed by security and they checked my bags for anything that was illegal or dangerous . They began to call for my plane and I got on line . I gave the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded the airplane . I put the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat down . Soon a person sat down next to me . We were told to eventually put our seat belts on as we were ready to fly . We watched a short video on what to do in case we felt some turbulence and what to do in case of emergency . Then the airplane lifted off and I was scared at first , I felt some shaking but eventually we were in the air and everything was okay . That was my favorite part . I love airplane food !

271	0,1	1,0	Tonight for dinner I decided to make myself an omelette to eat . I do n't like a lot of ingredients on my omelette so I just used a few mushrooms and green peppers . I opened a can of mushroom slices and diced a small amount of green peppers and onions very fine .  I sauteed them until they were softened . While the vegetables were cooking I cracked three eggs into a bowl and whipped them with a fork until they were mixed and frothy . When the vegetables were softened I dumped the eggs into the pan and turned the heat to medium .  When I saw the the sides were looking hardened , I carefully lifted one side and turned the pan to the side to let the runny eggs go underneath .  I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese and carefully slid the omelette onto a plate where I folded it over . I seasoned with some salt and pepper and it was delicious . What did they add?	mushrooms and green peppers	Gravy

276	0,1	0,1	Last summer I decided to go to Mexico with my cousins . It was a nice vacation and we were very excited to go . In order to get to Mexico , we had to fly a plane .

We were not only excited to be in Mexico , but we were excited to be on solid ground again . When did the turbulence make them feel afraid?	on the ground	When there was turbulence.

The paper is here . I slowly swing my legs around out of the bed and stand up , reaching to the adjacent chair I grab my robe and put it on . I shuffle stiffly down the stairs and to the door , turn both locks ... this sound prompts my great dane to come running down the stairs thinking there is an intruder ... Like we do n't go through the same routine nearly every day . I open the door a crack to lean out and grab the paper . Shutting the door I turn around and head towards the kitchen where my great dane patiently waits by his food dish . When did they put on the robe?	after hearing a thud	After getting out of bed

332	0,1	1,0	Yesterday I decided I wanted to get a newspaper so I could look at the print ads for Father 's Day gift ideas . Unfortunately , I had a problem . I do n't have a newspaper delivery at home , because I live in a rural area and the newspaper delivery does n't come to where I live . I decided to get a newspaper , so I drove to the grocery store , where there is a newspaper box that has the daily paper . I went to the newspaper box and realized I did n't have any change ; papers from the paper box cost fifty cents . I went into the grocery store and bought some groceries , and when I was paying for my groceries I asked the cashier to give me a dollar 's worth of quarters in with my change . I took the newspaper and drove home to look at the advertisements . What did the person put into the box?	their quarters	a newspaper

362	0,1	0,1	My stomach woke me up this morning . It was rumbling so loud , at first I thought it was an earthquake ! I jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen . I knew that I was going to need something that would fill my empty stomach up , so I decided to make an omelette . Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix my eggs in . I scrambled the eggs up with a fork , and then got a pan to put on the stove to cook the eggs in . After I turned on the stove , I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs would n't stick . Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited for the eggs to start to firm up . I poked at them with a spatula , pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly towards the middle of the pan . The uncooked runny eggs slide over to where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick ! When there was no more runny eggs left , I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette . Then I used my spatula to fold the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the sides of the omelette , kind of like a sandwich . My stomach roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette . I think it took me less than a minute to eat the whole thing ! When did they eat?	before cooking the omelette	after cooking

When there was no more runny eggs left , I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette . Then I used my spatula to fold the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the sides of the omelette , kind of like a sandwich . My stomach roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette . I think it took me less than a minute to eat the whole thing ! What was opened before getting the eggs?	the eggs	cabinet

382	0,1	0,1	I like to keep my kitchen clean . I try to clean it completely every day . Firstly , I make sure I put all the plates , pans and cups into the dishwasher . Then I fill a sink with hot water and wash the things that ca n't go in the dishwasher , like some of my pans and my sharp kitchen knives . I rinse and dry them and put them away . I make sure my counters are cleared of all the things that might get left on them , like a bag of chips , or the salt shaker . Then I spray the counters with soap and clean them off . Because I clean every day , nothing gets too grimy , so it 's usually pretty easy . Then I clean the stove top . I have a glass stove top , so I spray that with special cleaner , and leave it to sit for a few minutes . While the stove top cleaner is working , I use a damp , soapy cloth to wipe down the front of the refrigerator , the microwave and the dishwasher . I check to see if the microwave is clean . Then I rinse out the cloth and use it to clean off the stove top . Because food can get burned on to the stove top , sometimes I need to wipe it down two or three times . Finally I sweep the floor , to pick up any crumbs that might have fallen . When does it need cleaning?	Every week	every day

389	0,1	0,1	I was planning a relaxing vacation at the beach . There was only one problem : I did n't live anywhere near a beach ! Driving to one in a car would take up too much of my fun vacation time . I had to buy tickets for an airplane ride , which would take much less time because airplanes go very fast . I went to the website of my local airport and found the available planes traveling to the city where I wanted to go at the time I was going on vacation and bought a ticket . When it came time to go on my trip , I packed up my suitcases , drove to the airport before my plane was ready to fly , and parked my car . Inside the airport , I had to go through a long line for security , so that they can make sure there are no dangerous items being taken on the plane . The workers looked inside my suitcases with an X-Ray machine and checked the clothing I was wearing to make sure I was safe , too . When I was all done in security , I had to find the gate for my plane , where it would be ready to pick me and other passengers up . When it was time to board the plane , the stewardess helped me find my assigned seat and put my suitcase in the compartment above me . When all the passengers were on board , the stewardess explained what to do in an emergency , and the plane began to move . It became very noisy and all of a sudden , outside the window , I could see the ground get farther away . I felt like my body was being pushed against my seat a little bit . After a few minutes , the plane stopped going up and the stewardess told us we could take our seat belts off . She offered us drinks from a cart , and I was able to read a book I brought on the plane . I knew the ride would last a fair amount of time , so I made sure I had something to do . He told us to buckle our seat belts again , and the plane gently came closer to the ground . Finally , I felt a bump as the plane arrived at the airport in the new city . My plane ride was over , and my beach vacation was beginning . when did they buckled their seat belt?	when the plane was in the middle of the flight	Before taking off and landing.

I booked my flight months in advance to be sure I would have transportation to my vacation destination . The day I was about to leave I went to the airport hours in advance because I was nervous and excited . A nice lady checked my ticket and confirmed that my flight was on schedule . I then proceeded to the security check station where officers checked my bags and personal belongings . After the quick screening and a short wait my plane boarded . After some short instructions the plane taxied the runway and then sped up in a flash . I watched as the tires left the ground and we took to the sky . After several hours in the air the plane descended and touched down on a runway in Mexico . I was excited to get my vacation started .

I stumble out to the kitchen and add the grounds to the machine and pour in some water . I can not drink my coffee straight yet , I have to add some sweet things to take away the bitter taste . So I add a small amount of milk and about two teaspoons of sugar . I mix it all up really well and then just let it sit for a minute .

I will take off my gym clothes and wrap one of the towels they have there around my waist , and use the flip flops I keep in my gym locker . I open the door and I can immediately the heat . The walls , ceiling , and floor are wood and there is a metal heater in the center with very hot coals in it . Built against each wall are two rows of wooden benches . A few of my friends are there and they wave to me as I come in and sit down near them . Every one is relaxing quietly in the heat and I am already red and sweating a lot . I sit in there as long as I can stand it , before I leave and jump up and rush out and into the cold water pool they have next to it . My skin is red and tingly and I feel great so I head back into the sauna to do it again . I will usually do this a few times before I finally have to go get dressed and head home .

636	0,1	0,1	Once upon a time , it was time for a little girl to eat her breakfast before going to school . It does n't really matter what the little girl 's name was , but we 'll call her Jenny . The first thing Jenny needed to do to get her breakfast ready was to make orange juice . Jenny did n't want to go to school , much less make orange juice , so Jenny told her mommy that she had forgotten how to make orange juice . Jenny 's mommy -- we 'll call her Mommy -- was not stupid and did not believe Jenny but Mommy decided that this would be a great learning opportunity for both of them so she went along with it . Mommy took a sharp knife and very carefully cut the orange into two equal halves . Then , she gently removed the orange peels from each half . After that , she opened the electric juicer sitting on the kitchen counter and tossed in both halves of the orange before closing the lid and starting the juicer . When the machine was finished , Mommy handed the jar to Jenny and said , `` Crisis averted . Go upstairs and get ready for school . '' Jenny pouted but drank the fresh orange juice before sullenly going upstairs to get ready for another day of learning . Where was the orange bought from?	The school.	the market.

I always try to make Ian the King 's champion , fighting the bad guys , or even a dragon sometimes , and winning . Sometimes I make it so that Ian is the last man standing against a huge army ! I always try to see Ian in my mind so I can describe what he looks like : a knight in shining armor , a space man or even just , Ian . I then picture the location of the battle and see it in my mind . As I tell the story I describe the location in detail so he can see it as well in his mind . Regardless though I imagine what my hero is doing to win the battle and tell the story as best as I can . He 's always my hero . Who always saves in the stories?	Ian.	bad guy

The first is to help them digest well , the second is for nutritional value and the third is to boost immunity so they do n't become easily sick . I begin by opening the top of the fish tank and shaking some of the first brand of food into the tank . Then I shake in some of the second food and make sure the fish consume as much as they can . I repeat this process at the end of the day , but give them the third brand as well . What did the fish swallow?	fish food	Water

It was n't looking good for our team . Even though our team scored , we were always behind . Then it started to snow and we were getting cold . We all cheered like crazy .

712	0,1	0,1	I like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes . I start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub . Some tubs have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close it . After it 's closed I like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then I let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub . While the water is running , I squirt in bubbles and make sure I have a clean washcloth and towel . After I carefully climb into the tub , I make sure I wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes . Fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks . Once the water starts to turn a little cold , it 's time to get out so I open the drain again and let the water empty out . While it 's draining I carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off . I always be sure the tub is clean when I 'm finished , with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong . Where do they soak and relax?	in the shower	in the bathtub

715	0,1	0,1	I like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes . I start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub . Some tubs have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close it . After it 's closed I like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then I let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub . While the water is running , I squirt in bubbles and make sure I have a clean washcloth and towel . After I carefully climb into the tub , I make sure I wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes . Fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks . Once the water starts to turn a little cold , it 's time to get out so I open the drain again and let the water empty out . While it 's draining I carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off . I always be sure the tub is clean when I 'm finished , with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong .

717	0,1	0,1	Last week , I decided that it was time to start mowing the lawn for the season . I got the mower out of the garage and put it out back . It was heavy to lift over the weather so I needed help from my dad to lift it . Once I got to the yard , I started to turn it on and mow the lawn . I went up and down each row of grass slowly . I noticed everything getting cut and I continued to mow the lawn . Upon finishing , I took the lawn mower back inside and lifted it back over the washer and dryer and into the garage . The whole process took almost an hour for a small yard then . Where did they bring the object to?	house	yard

742	0,1	1,0	Yesterday I went to my friend 's house for dinner . She made a lasagna , which takes a while in the oven , so she asked if I wanted to play a board game in the meantime . I had never played Monopoly before , and I 've always wanted to learn how , so she got the game out of her closet and started to set up . She would be the banker , the person in charge of collecting payments as we went . Each space on the board is a property that you can buy when you land on it , and after that other players get charged rent if they land on it . I thought I understood , but I told her that usually I like to learn by doing , so I suggested that we just start playing and I 'd pick up the rest of the rules as we went .

757	0,1	0,1	When I visited London last summer , I decided that I would like to live there . I went home and looked for flats or apartments as well call them in America , on a website . The London real estate was very expensive and I knew it would take awhile to find a flat to call home . I was looking for an affordable one bedroom or a studio flat with one bathroom that was close to the shopping district downtown . I called a real estate agent in London and asked if they could find my something . We decided to meet in a month and the agent would take me around the city to find the perfect flat for my needs . So , when I met her , we travelled throughout the city and I eventually found the flat I would call home . Where were not too many flats they could afford?	in America	In London

760	0,1	0,1	I went shopping for some new pairs of socks two weekends ago . I planned out in advance a store I knew would have the specific kind of socks I needed , and then I drove there . I went into the store and started browsing through their selection .  Searching for a specific size would be useless because socks do not necessarily match to a single shoe size , plus socks ( and many other clothes ) are known to quickly shrink after being washed a few times . After narrowing down my options I more carefully visually compared the size of a few different pairs . I selected the one I thought would be the best fit .  I immediately tried them on when I arrived back home ( if I ever have the opportunity I will first try on the clothes at the store to make sure they fit , but this is not possible for socks sold in packs ) . They took what to the register?	A pair of shoes	The pack of socks

I flipped through a magazine , and about five minutes later my name was called . The apron was to keep water and hair off my clothes during my appointment . She brought me over to a sink and sat me in front of it . The sink has a special notch so you can lean your head back comfortably . I sat in a swivel chair in front of a mirror . The chair swivels so the stylist can turn me and reach different areas of my hair . She asked me how I 'd like my hair cut . I told her I 'd like her to cut a few inches off , and to give my hair some layers to fluff it up . Every so often , she - asked me how I liked it so far . When she finished , she gave a mirror to hold and turned the chair around . I was able to hold the mirror in front of my face , and at the same time , see the back of my head in the large mirror . She blew-dry my hair , and added some styling mousse . I gave her a tip , then I paid for the haircut at the front desk . I almost forgot to take off the apron before I left .

789	0,1	1,0	I was getting pretty hungry , but there was n't much in the house , except some frozen chicken , and a few carrots and potatoes , and some spices . Since I did n't have any money on me , I decided I would make some chicken soup . I took out a pot , poured some water in , and added the chicken . I continued to boil the chicken while preparing the carrots and potatoes . I took out a vegetable peeler and started to peel the carrots , and when I was satisfied , I pulled out a knife and cutting board and proceeded to slice the carrots on the cutting board . I went back to the boiling chicken and stirred it around a bit , and then went to the potatoes I had put on the counter . I washed off some of the dirt from the potatoes but did n't work that hard at it because I was going to peel them anyway . I then proceeded to dig out the potato 's `` eyes '' which are essentially little buds or sprouts that will form new potatoes . I then peeled the potatoes and rinsed them off and finally I sliced them up . At this time the chicken was about done , so I pulled out the chicken pieces and proceeded to peel the meat from the bones and then discarded the bones . I then put the chicken pieces back in and the rest of the spices and stirred it around . Finally I poured a bowl of soup for myself , making sure I got pieces of chicken , carrots and potatoes . It was still very hot and I had to sit and blow on it for a while until it became cool enough to eat . By this time , my Dad had come home and he was hungry too , so instead of lunch we ate an early dinner of this delicious soup . Finally finished with the soup which was very good , I put the empty dishes into the dishwasher to be cleaned later .

Wheat bread is said to be somewhat healthier for us , compared to white bread .  Once I decide on which bread to use for my sandwich , I choose which condiments I 'm going to use on my sandwich .  I squirt my condiment of choice onto both pieces of bread and then I smooth it out with a knife so that the distribution will cover each piece of bread . My choice of meat comes next , followed by which cheese I 'm going to use on my sandwich . When it comes to meat , my favorite is Honey Turkey because I find the flavor to be very delicious .  I lay the meat on one piece of bread and I lay the cheese on the other piece of bread . Then I smush the two pieces of bread together , place it on a plate so the crumbs will have somewhere to fall , and begin to eat . What do they want on their sandwich?	Honey Chicken	Honey Turkey

If I need to , I 'll count sheep until I am no longer awake and drift off to dreamland . What do they and the puppy do while in the bed?	eat	Watch tv and scroll through social media
848	0,1	1,0	I was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home . I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . Flustered and embarrassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning . What did the person hand to the driver?	Money.	a bus pass

862	0,1	0,1	Today I decided to do some decorating around my apartment . I had a painting I bought at an art festival that I had not hung up on the wall yet . It is a beautiful still life painting of a bouquet of flowers in a vase . At first , I thought of putting up the painting in the dining room . However , it did n't really seem to compliment the other wall art in the room . Then I thought about putting up the painting in the living room . I thought this looked much better . I took the painting and hung it on this nail and adjusted the sides so that the painting looked straight .

865	0,1	0,1	There was a vending machine at my dorm in college . I bought from it often . One time stands out more than the others , though . I have collected exactly $ 3.15 . This was all in quarters , nickles , and dimes . When I got to the machine , after I bought my food , a woman came up to the machine and tried to buy a Kit-Kat . I did n't know her well , but the machine failed . I did n't have any more money , or I would have helped her by purchasing a Kit-Kat myself . instead , we pounded on the glass and pushed at the machine . I did n't want to risk rocking it because it was very heavy and would be lethal if it fell . So , we just stood there frustrated , until someone else I did n't know came up and asked about our predicament . I did n't know this fellow , either . So she got what she ordered , and we were all happy . How long did they have to wait before the candy bar finally fell down?	few hours	Until someone else showed up

I prefer my bacon crispy , as my husband prefers his bacon a bit more tender . We take our time and really savor every bits . I love lazy Saturdays .

899	0,1	0,1	The fishing day went really well and Allan was looking forward to his dinner of freshly-caught , fried fish . He had filleted the fish as soon as he returned to the dock and now he rinsed and dried each fillet . He took some saltine crackers and crushed them in a plastic bag , using a rolling pin . He put some flour on another plate and added some salt and pepper and mixed them with the flour . Next , Allan cracked two eggs into a bowl and added a couple of spoonfuls of water . With a fork , he quickly stirred the egg and water until they were blended together . He added oil to about a half an inch . While the oil was heating , he took one fillet in his right hand and set it in the flour mixture and completely covered the fish . He then took the fillet and dipped it in the egg and then set the fish on the cracker crumbs . He then carefully set the breaded fillet into the hot oil . When the edges of the fillet were starting to brown , he took tongs and carefully turned the fillet over . In just a few minutes , the bottom edges were also browning so he removed the fish from the pan with the tongs . He set the fish on some paper towels to soak up the excess oil and then moved it to his dinner plate . Where where the saltine crackers put?	in a bowl	in a plastic bag

It 's a story about a princess who lives on top of 20 mattresses , and she can feel the pea under the bottom most mattress . It 's a ridiculous story , but the kids love it and laugh so hard at the idea that a princess can feel a pea from that many mattresses high ! This one was about a very hungry caterpillar , and their favorite part is when he turns into a beautiful butterfly . That part is the " climax " of the story , or the turning point for the story . Each story has a beginning , climax , and end . The stories I tell my kids before bed serve the purpose of helping them have good dreams and fall asleep . When did they tell the story?	night before last night	Before bed last night.

Then the lady at the desk called my name and showed me to a big comfy chair . There were all sorts of different things in the room . Shiny things , pictures of white teeth , and machines .

She told me that candy can hurt teeth sometimes , but eating lots of healthy foods help them to be strong like the ones on the poster on the wall . After we were done cleaning my teeth , the lady at the desk smiled at me and gave me some toothpaste and a little box of floss . Then we went home . I love the dentist ! who did the cleaning?	the lady at the desk	dentist

937	0,1	1,0	When the weather started getting nice this spring I decided that I wanted to start a garden . A friend with a large yard said I was welcome to plant it there . I built some raised beds and purchased enough soil to fill them . I planted things that I would enjoy eating including tomatoes , green beans , basil , mint , parsley , zucchini , cucumbers , lettuce and some wildflowers to make it pretty and to encourage bees . I did have to put some chicken wire around some of the plants because I noticed some of the plants looked like something was chewing on them , as the plants started getting bigger I also had to make some supports for the tomatoes and beans so they did n't fall over . As things were grown and ready I picked them , I offered some of the vegetables to my friend and I took the rest home and enjoyed them . What needed to be done?	Build raised beds.	feed the rabbits

941	0,1	1,0	Yesterday I went to a toy store to find a good board game to play with my friends . I found a famous game called " Risk " , a battle and conquer game recommended by the salesman of the store . I got home and unpacked the game . I read the instructions and it looked very nice , but when my friends arrived and we started to play , then I realized how good the game was . On the board there is a representation of the world divided in like 70 countries . At the beginning you receive randomly some of those countries and your mission is to start conquering other countries establishing battles using dice . It is so exciting , because you first aim to conquer continents , and then you have to be aggressive to start conquering other countries and other continents until you conquer the whole world . What was the game?	Risk	70 countries

Things were tense . I had controller , but I knew that if I did n't let her have her say she 'd just go to sleep . \ nIn seconds , the Netflix logo was on the screen and the little loading bar was going left to right . I recall the movie Labyrinth was first on the screen and for the record I do n't like that movie much . My girlfriend however will watch it anytime and anywhere . That , I 'd decided , was the failure state ; watching Labyrinth again . I hoped that she had n't seen Labyrinth on the screen . Anyway , the movie I got to eventually , after holding the stick for a while , was Babe . I had n't seen that movie in years . I just thought , whatever , and pushed the button .

It 's nice , pleasant , light but , a little boring . So , we decided we were going to add what is called an accent wall in the dining room . We would paint one wall a burnt orange color while all of the other walls in the dining room would stay white . So , while I stayed home and moved all of the furniture away from the wall , and threw a blanket over everything , my wife went down to the store and bought the paint . While she was gone , I also cleaned the wall so no dirt or anything would be trapped beneath the paint . The first step was to prime it . I did around the edges while my wife used a roller to do the center . We then waited a day for the primer to dry , then switched jobs with the actual painting . I rolled the center while she cut in around the edges . It turned out beautifully . what drew the attention?	The neighborhood	The accent wall.

When that did n't work , I went downstairs to get the plunger out of the garage . I went back into the bathroom with the plunger , and put the plunger in the toilet , making sure to form a tight seal around the bottom of the toilet bowl . I then pushed down on the plunger several times , hoping that the pressure from the plunging would unclog the toilet . I flushed again to see if the toilet was unclogged . It still was not . I repeated my last few steps , forming a seal with the plunger around the bottom of the bowl , and pushing down on the plunger several times more , in order to push the clog through the pipe where it was stuck . I then flushed once more . I rinsed the plunger off and put it back in the garage . What was expected to swirl into the bowl?	The water after flushing.	The plunger.

In order for them to thrive and live healthily , I have to water them daily and make sure they get plenty of sunshine . To water my house plants , I fill up a pitcher from the tap water in the kitchen sink and pour it directly into the dirt until the soil is moist to touch . Once the soil feels moist , I spray the leaves with a small spray bottle . I repeat this process daily and notice my plants growing and looking shiny . That 's how I know they 've received enough water and nourishment to grow into healthier plants . I 'm happy with the system i 've developed . What do they make sure not to over water?

1025	0,1	0,1	We carefully planned my daughter 's fifth birthday party . We looked very forward to it and paid attention to all the details such as the games we would play and the type of cake and ice cream that we would serve . The theme of the party was " pink unicorns " and it was not easy to find pink unicorn decorations at the party store . We decided to make it a family mission to make our own party decorations and we had a great time doing that together . On the morning of the long awaited party , my daughter woke up and had a bad sore throat with a low grade fever . She insisted she wanted to go forward with the party but I knew she was not well enough plus I did not want her to be around her friends if she had something they could catch . There was also a light rain outside . As disappointing as it was , we divided the list of children that were supposed to attend the party between my husband and myself and each of us took sixteen names . We each called sixteen parents and told them that the party had to be cancelled and we would notify them with a reschedule date . The weather was perfect and five more children were able to attend so it ended up being a wonderful day ! What was a big success?	the original birthday party	daughter's fifth birthday party

She insisted she wanted to go forward with the party but I knew she was not well enough plus I did not want her to be around her friends if she had something they could catch . There was also a light rain outside . As disappointing as it was , we divided the list of children that were supposed to attend the party between my husband and myself and each of us took sixteen names . We each called sixteen parents and told them that the party had to be cancelled and we would notify them with a reschedule date . The weather was perfect and five more children were able to attend so it ended up being a wonderful day ! What was sent out for the party?	Invitations.	Birthday presents.

It was a tiny one bedroom , one bathroom apartment with a small kitchen , dining room and a decent sized living room . Put simply , there just was not enough storage space , so everything ended up piling up on the floor . Laundry , both clean and dirty ended up in a basket or on the floor because there was no room in the closet . When we moved out we spent two or three days cleaning the place . So , we each picked an area of the apartment and just started . We threw away everything we could live without and stuffed clothes in to garbage bags to take them to the laundry mat . We scrubbed dishes and put them away and then scrubbed down the counters once everything was off of them . How many closets we're in the bedroom?	three	one

Inside the laundry room , there is a washing machine that my mom calls the Washer . There is also a drying machine that she calls the Dryer . My mom looks through the pile of dirty clothes and picks out the clothes that are all white . For the first load of laundry , my mom always puts in the colorful clothes .

I have to watch them carefully , even the ones I do not like and I think are boring . I watch the movies and tell people the things I do like and the things I do not like . Some movies are fun and make me laugh and some make me scared . Some people do not even go to see movies if I say that the movies are no good . I must not let anything distract me from my job . Hopefully the next movie I watch will be a big hit that everyone loves . What do they watch during the job?	Movies.	videos

1057	0,1	1,0	Babysitting for most people is something of a burden that they begrudgingly accept to help out family or for pay . In my home however babysitting my little niece was always a time i looked forward to , from making forts to playing video games all afternoon there was never a dull moment . Her mother would drop her off in the morning at a time we both previously agreed to and i would have breakfast ready for her when she arrived . After breakfast we 'd go outside and build and rebuild forts in the backyard , she tells me that this is one of the reasons why she is now so into fantasy novels and such . Later on in the afternoon we 'd sit down in front of the tv and watch one of the lord of the rings films , these are both of our favorite films of all time and never tire of them . In the evening when her mother came to pick her up her mood would sour a bit but i 'd always remind her that there 's always next weekend and she 'd light up again . What did the person love?	build forts in the backyard	babysitting nephew

We made sure to dress up nicely , since we were going to be in a public place and did n't want to look badly dressed . The first thing we did was take my younger brother for a haircut . While he was getting that done , my parents and I went to the food court just across the floor from the barber shop to order some lunch . We saved a plate for my brother for when he was done with his haircut . We visited a pet adoption place just to see the dogs that were there . We also visited a sports store , since my brother and dad are big sports fans . My mom went and visited several women 's stores to look for things like clothes and makeup . Once we were done , we left and came back home . When did they get there?	the past weekend	today

Bills are payments of money that have to be made to pay for specific services , like water , electricity , and Wi-Fi . One monthly bill that my parents are constantly having to pay is the water bill . This notice has on it the amount of money that needs to be paid along with the date that it needs to be paid by . If the bill is not paid by this date , then the company that provides us with water will send us a disconnection notice in the mail . This lets them know that if my parents do n't pay the bill soon , the company can shut off the water to our house , which wo n't allow us to do things like take showers , wash dishes , or do laundry . So , to avoid all of this , one of my parents will take whatever amount of money that is owed out of their bank account along with the bill they got in the mail , and take that to the nearest water company office to pay it off .

1101	0,1	1,0	I 've been looking on-line at photographs and prices of homes for along time searching for something that would suit my family . I entered all the criteria that I need which included three bedrooms , at least two bathrooms , a garage and it had to be in the right school district and of course in my price ranage . My search came up with about half a dozen homes that could be right for me . I contacted the realtor listed on my favorite home and we met early on Saturday morning to start looking at all the homes I had found . Each home had both positives and negatives and I tried to prioritize which were the most important to our family . One had a gorgeous yard , but absolutely no closet space , and one had large bedrooms , but no garage . I told the real estate agent how much to offer them which was about $ 20,000 less than the price they had listed it for . She let them know and they came back and suggested we meet in the middle at ten thousand less than the original price but ten thousand more than I had offered . My real estate agent assured me this was a good deal , so we agreed . I had an inspector come look around the house to make sure there were no major issues that we did n't notice . He did n't find anything to worry about , so we set I gave a deposit and we set up a date to close on the home once my mortgage was fully approved at the bank . I applied for my mortgage and I was approved quickly and was so excited when we set the closing date and the home would be mine . When did they visit?	Early on Saturday morning	sunday morning

1113	0,1	0,1	My wife and I go for walks every night after we unwind . We usually come home from work , have dinner , take showers and get our stuff ready for work the next day . Once we are done with that ( weather permitting ) we go out and take a stroll around the neighborhood . We do this for health reasons as well as just to relax as it gives us some time to walk and talk about things . We leave our phones inside ( at home ) so we do n't have any distractions and can actually talk to one another about our days and how everything is going . We get really bummed out in the winter and on rainy days when we can not do this as during the weekdays this is our favorite time of the day . Where are the people walking around?	house	The neighborhood.

Then I climbed into the seat . I zoomed around my yard , happily clipping my unsightly grass . Afterward , I rolled the mower back into the garage and turned it off . Then , I took the key from the ignition and hung it on the rack . The grass looked great ! When were they done paying for the gas?	before getting a couple of gallons of gas	When at the gas station.

I am not really the beach type of person , but he is letting me stay for free and there are many other things to do around his house besides going to the beach . In particular , there is a eight-mile long bike trail through one of the state parks . The trouble is I do not have a bike and my friend only has one . Luckily the state park not only offers a tour along the bike trail , they also a have a few bikes for hire . Of course this is on a first-come-first-served basis . During the tour , the guide stopped us a various sections and told us about the various flora and fauna and landmarks . We did not stop for about a good mile , during which the trial was pretty much a straight away . I got up to a good speed on my bike but got surprised by a sudden sharp turn . My clumsy self of course took the turn too fast and fell into the marsh grass much to my embarrassment and laughter of the others . When do they arrive where the bike tour meets?	after getting the bikes.	after arriving at friend's beach house

1195	0,1	0,1	Yesterday I noticed that my 10 year old daughter Belle , was n't feeling very well . She seemed to have a fever , so I found the thermometer in the medicine cabinet and checked Belle 's temperature . It was 100 degrees , so I called her Dr. Barnes and he told us to come in as early as possible . We drove to his office on Willow road , and waited there for half an hour . He said that Belle had the flu and prescribed antibiotics , which luckily taste like strawberry . We drove to the pharmacy and pick up the medicine . The pharmacist told us to give two teaspoons on the first day , and then one teaspoon daily for 5 days , even if she felt better earlier than that . Belle sat on the couch as I measured with a syringe to take exactly 5 ml , just like the instructions specified , and poured onto a spoon . She liked the taste . I told her she was a good girl and she will start feeling better soon . We repeated this later than night , and again in the following 4 days , until we were done . Who is back to her old self?	the son	Belle

He had white hair and a white mustache , and he glanced over the menu at the bar through little glasses that clipped onto his nose .  I asked him what kind of Champagne cocktail , and he snorted derisively , insisting that he wanted the only Champagne cocktail there is . I was confused , because many cocktails have champagne in them . I went over to the big book of cocktails , dusted it off , and flipped through it until I found the drink .  Sure enough , there was a listing that simply read " Champagne Cocktail " it consisted of a sugar cube , Champagne , brandy , and Angostura Bitters .

1239	0,1	0,1	My family decided that we would make clothes to match for Halloween . So today I started sewing the clothes for the day . The first thing I had to do was pull the strand of thread through the small loop of the needle .  After some time , I had a shirt sewed up . I had to make sure it would fit me , so I measured it around myself and it fit perfectly when it was done . Next I had to start making the pants .  I measured the fabric around myself once again , and this helped figure out how much fabric to cut off .  I used these as the template to create the next pair for my parents and my brother . I had a really great time making these clothes . When did they sew the pants together?	Before they measured the fabric	after the shirt was finished

1247	0,1	0,1	I notice that I have cut myself . While it does n't hurt and is n't bleeding very much I know it 's important to clean it and protect it from infection and further injury . I wash it gently under warm water using soap . I inspect the wound visually and see the bleeding is going to stop and it 's not to deep so I know I do n't need to see a doctor . From my first aid supplies I select antibacterial ointment and bandages that are the right size for the cut . I do n't want to contaminate the cut so I apply the ointment to the bandage itself which I then place to cover the cut . Then I wrap further bandaging materials around the initial bandage and wrap the entire thing well with a binding bandage and adhesive tape . What was run for quite a while?	cold water	warm water

1291	0,1	0,1	Ever since I was a child my parents and dentist stressed the importance of dental hygiene . Brushing , flossing and rinsing with mouth wash is the best way to prevent tooth decay and cavities , of course . So still to this day I use the same dental habits I had as child . Before brushing I put a pea sized dab of mint toothpaste on my toothbrush , then I brush for about 3 minutes and rinse with mouth wash to get the remaining food out of my mouth before bed . When I wake up in the morning , I use the dental floss picks to floss well before brushing my teeth again . I make sure to put the cap on my toothbrush to prevent it from getting dirty , and I use the throw away floss picks so they 're clean and fresh when I need them . When did they start to brush their teeth twice a day?	since being an adult	As a child

1295	0,1	1,0	My son and I decided that we wanted to go camping somewhere not too far from where we live . I looked online and found a campsite that had lots of activities . There was a lake and some biking trails so we would bring our swimsuits and our bicycles . The website said that the campground was first come first serve so we decided to get there early , around 3 pm . When we got to the campground they assigned us a spot near the lake . We went to the campsite and unloaded our tent and set it up . We purchased some firewood at the store so we could have an evening fire . After our swim we went back to the campsite and started our fire . We made a nice dinner and read some stories before we went to bed . In the morning we rode our bikes on the bike trails and when we got back we pulled down the tent and packed up the car . What besides the tent and sleeping bags were loaded?	swimsuits and bicycles	bike trails

We have to make sure to do this to have peace of mind and to be sure that everyone is safe and that the home is protected . We start by shutting all the windows , closing up the doors and the shutters and being sure that everything is in place . I double check the windows and doors and make sure the locks are all up and turned to locked rather than open .

Once the judge entered the courtroom , we all rose from our seats as is customary in order to chow respect for the law . Once the judge told us to be seated , I sat back down . Once he called my name , I rose from my seat along with my attorney . My attorney did the talking and I only spoke when I was directly spoken to . What did they enter after turning off the phone?	car	courtroom
1405	0,1	1,0	when it comes to do the things in home by yourself , it needs more preparation than the professionals when they are at work . I was planning to paint the walls in my home . It was kind of stressful to me , especially i did n't want to look like mass . I emptied the whole room completely , and then used the papers those I saved when I moved . Those were big so it was easy to handle and they were quite sturdy and firm . I started with one side of the wall , and I covered each space by arranging them next to each other , and overlapping them , so it does n't leave any space in between . Then I put the tape where I overlapped them so while walking on it , will not move them from its space.I made sure that it was secured on the edges , specially on the area which was close to walls . It was good to go . What did they decide to do to the whole room?	Empty it	Clean it.

When I was young he taught me to play . He showed me the irons , woods and the putter and when each was used . We went out to a driving range where we got buckets of golf balls to practice our swings with the different clubs.One of the first things he taught me is how to grip the clubs . Finally he took me out to the golf course . Well , golf is a difficult game to play well . I learned many golf terms - par , birdie , bogey , putt , rough , sandtrap , watertrap , whiff , and many more . It a frustrating day on the course , but boy , did I learn a lot about playing golf . Who knew uncle Rolf?	the author	the golf instructor

1413	0,1	0,1	When I woke up this morning I was hungrier than usual , hungry enough that food was more important than coffee . Ignoring the lure of the coffee maker I headed across the kitchen and opened the breadbox . There it was , one perfect , untouched loaf of nutty , grainy Italian bread . Sawing through the thick crust and trying not to squash the delicate insides , I measured off four thin slices . Now the question was whether to toast them in the toaster or the oven . It was cool outside so I opted for the oven . Taking out a cookie sheet I covered it with foil , spread the bread out on the foil and put some butter in the microwave to melt . The butter melted and once ready I drizzled it lightly over the bread . I stood in anticipation as the top of the bread slowly crisped and turned brown and waited for the perfect moment to snatch it from the oven . The bread smelled and looked amazing . What were they eagerly to do?	Make coffee	Eat food

It shaped the way I thought about theology , and it 's a good moral lesson for anyone , no matter what you believe . The preacher drew a straight line , going upward . He marked x 's on the line . He said that each one represented a blessing God wants to give you , but that you do n't always get them . So he 'd draw a line around one of the x 's showing that you skipped it and did n't get it . And then he said without Jesus , you ca n't get a single one of these blessings . As an 11 year old , this got my attention . Where was a preacher?	At church.	home

1429	0,1	0,1	When I needed to get a new job , I decided to expand my options by looking in several different places . First , I checked my local newspaper for any job listings in the " Help Wanted " section . There was 1 job that I thought might suit me , so I circled it with a black marker and set that page aside for later . The website was really helpful because it let me search using my personal preferences , including my location , my years of experience , whether or not I had a college degree , and what type of salary I wanted to be paid . I found 10 listings that I wanted to follow up on , so I bookmarked those pages using my internet browser . Finally , I went down to the local grocery store to check out their bulletin board , since lots of local businesses post " Help Wanted " posters there . I did n't find any that interested me , so I went back home . I gathered together the information from the 11 jobs I found online and in the newspaper and sat down to decide which of the jobs I should definitely apply for and which I should consider my back-ups . I decided to apply for all of the internet jobs , but not for the job listing I found in the newspaper . The internet jobs were all related to my degree , which is in library science , so they were more relevant than the newspaper posting which was for a housekeeper . The job listing website had a feature that would let me send my resume to the companies online , so I uploaded my resume to my computer and started applying for the jobs .

1436	0,1	1,0	Tonight was spaghetti dinner night ! I loved when we had spaghetti for dinner because everybody sat down at the table and ate together . After everyone ate , my mom asked me to clear the table . First I collected all the empty dishes and put them in the sink . Not all the plates were empty so I took a spoon and emptied all the leftover food in the trash . My mom always reminds me to do that before putting the dish in the sink because she says leftover food will clog up the dish drain . I put all the used glasses and cups on the counter near the sink . Mom says not to put them inside the sink with the other dishes because they can easily break . Once all the dishes were away , I wiped the table off with a wet cloth . Now , it looked as if it did before we ate . when did the mom give them a chore to do by themselves?	After dinner.	In the morning.

Not all the plates were empty so I took a spoon and emptied all the leftover food in the trash . My mom always reminds me to do that before putting the dish in the sink because she says leftover food will clog up the dish drain . I put all the used glasses and cups on the counter near the sink . Mom says not to put them inside the sink with the other dishes because they can easily break . Once all the dishes were away , I wiped the table off with a wet cloth . Now , it looked as if it did before we ate . When was the mom really proud of them?	once the dishes were put away	Before the chores were done.

1455	0,1	0,1	Today I decided to put new flooring in my bedroom . I had already taken out my old flooring and was just left with a plain , ugly wood floor , called a sub-floor . I cleaned and swept my sub floor and laid down a thin layer of padding that goes underneath your flooring . I opened up the package and took out my long floorboards . These floorboards fit together with each other , just like a puzzle . I started on one side of my room and laid the floorboards together , fitting each new piece to the previous piece I had just put down . Sometimes I had to use my hand or a rubber mallet to bang the floorboards together , because it was such a tight fit . What did they repeat?	Buying floorboards	Fitting the floorboards together

1462	0,1	0,1	Last weekend , my friend Jose and I painted his living room wall red ! He called me , and asked me to come over and please help him . The wall he wanted to paint is very tall , and his wife wanted to paint it red . Only one of the walls will be red , and then the others are white like normal . The red wall is the accent wall . So , Jose and I started by putting a drop cloth on the floor , so we would not spill any paint on the carpet . Next , we used tape to cover the edges of the wall doors and molding , so the paint would not cover those spots . It was so red ! We had a lot of fun making sure that the whole wall was covered . We had to use even strokes , when we covered the wall with paint . It came out great ! What do they call because it accents the room?	room with an accent	accent wall

We arrived at the bowling alley and it was packed , but we already made our reservations , and our lane is nicely prepped for us .  All clean .  This alley also has a eatery inside , so the waitress came over to see if we wanted to order anything .  Waitress came back with out food and drinks pretty quick , in about 15 minutes. , I thought it would be longer given how packed it was . This game is not going in my favor . I keep getting splits .

1481	0,1	1,0	I was looking in the mirror two weeks ago and thought my hair was getting too long , it looked scruffy and was getting difficult to style . I called my hairdresser and made an appointment to go and see her the following week to get a hair cut . It was difficult getting an appointment because she was very busy but I managed to get one . I walked inside and spoke to the lady on the reception desk to tell her who I was and who I was there to see , and she asked me to take a seat in the waiting area . There were lots of hair products on shelves around where I was sitting , and some hair style magazines on a table in front of the sofa I was sitting on . My stylist came through a door and greeted me and took me past people sitting on chairs in front of mirrors , all of them in various stages of having a hair cut . I sat down at my stylist 's usual chair and faced the mirror while she asked me what I wanted her to do . Sometimes when I go to see her I will have a picture of a style that I like that I have found on the internet or in a magazine but this time I just wanted her to keep it the same style but make it shorter . First of all she took me to an area with basins for washing hair and I had to sit with my back to it , with my head tilted back so my hair was in the basin . My stylist rolled up a towel and put it under the back of my neck to make the position more comfortable and washed my hair for me . After she was done she took me back to the chair and started to cut my hair , she pinned up sections of hair that she was n't working on and gradually let them down to cut them , eventually she had done all of it . She plugged in the hairdryer and sprayed some lotion onto my hair to make it easier to blow dry and proceeded to dry my hair until it was all dry and styled and shorter . When she was finished she held up a mirror for me so I could see the back of my hair . I was happy with it so I said goodbye and walked back to the lady on the reception desk to pay her for the hair cut . Where did they drive to?	the hairdresser's salon	the market

1494	0,1	0,1	For Christmas last year , my family had a very big get together and everyone was tasked with making and\/or bringing a food item . I did n't know what to bring , so I simply asked my Aunt what she would like . She told me that she would love a cake , as there was a shortage of people bringing dessert . I looked throughout my pantry and realized I had everything I needed . I went ahead and made it the evening before using all of the ingredients . I mixed the flour , sugar , water , eggs and even made my own frosting and did n't use one from a can . It turned out very moist , sweet and very good tasting . Everyone seemed to enjoy it . Afterwards , my aunt and other family members thanked me very much . I was very happy with myself . Where did they bring the cake?	pantry	christmas' big get together

I surprised her with the news and she seemed very happy . When we got there the attendant took our information and asked what services we would be needing . I arranged for massages for both of us and we were given locker keys and robes . We parted ways to go into the appropriate locker rooms and change into our robes and the swimwear we brought along . Then we both went into a private sauna room and closed the wooden door . There was a pot of hot coals in the middle of the room and we had been instructed how to use it . I took a ladle of water from the pedestal in the corner and poured it on the hot coals . Soon the sauna was filled with warm soothing steam and we both laid down together on the benches and took in the sensations . We became extremely relaxed and had forgotten about the stresses of work . Afterwards , we both changed back into our clothing and headed home for a stress-free weekend .

The previous residents of the house we live in had used wallpaper on the living room walls that was a very odd shade of red , which we thought looked strange . We wanted the living room to get a new color of wallpaper , and we wanted to choose a color that would match our personality .  We looked at the wallpaper color samples and picked up a few brochures with examples of how the samples would look on our walls . We decided that a cheery yellow color would look best on our walls , and selected that color . We then returned to Sherwin-Williams and purchased the yellow wallpaper . Where did they apply the wallpaper?	They applied the wallpaper in their living room.	They applied the wallpaper in their bedroom.

1636	0,1	1,0	Two weeks ago I was out golfing with my friends . We were having a good time and not paying too much attention to the sun , although it was very hot . My friend was about to hit his ball when he started complaining of being dizzy . We knew the symptoms of heat stroke and called 911 . They instructed us to move our friend to a shady area and to lay him down with his head propped up . They told us to cool him down with water , and try to get him to take liquids . We gave them our location and stayed on the phone with them until help arrived . We could hear the sound of the ambulance in the distance . We were relieved to hear that sound .

1649	0,1	0,1	It was a sad day . June 's great Aunt Martha had died a few days ago , and today was the day they would have her funeral . Everyone in her family was dressed nicely , and made there way across town to the funeral home where the service would be held . As the entered the room , there was a strong smell of flowers that made June 's nose ache a little . Her mom signed a book with her and her brothers names , and they made there way into a parlor where other people had gathered . At the front of the room was a casket that was half way opened with Aunt Martha 's body lying in it . She looked as if she was taking a nap in her finest clothes . Her make up and hair did n't really look like she used to wear them , but she did n't look scary like June had imagined . They met some family members that were sad and crying , but others were laughing and remembering funny stories about Aunt Martha . They made there way to a seat at the back of the parlor and a few songs were played while the curtains were drawn in the front of the room . A pastor stood up and said some really nice things about Aunt Martha , and prayed . The curtains closed again and the pastor told the crowd that the funeral would resume at Shady Oak Cemetery . Afterwards , the group of people that had gathered made there ways to their car for the funeral procession to the cemetery . June 's family followed a long line of cars following a hearse with Aunt Martha 's casket in the back . A police man escorted the group of cars , and stopped traffic so the funeral procession did n't have to stop at red lights on the way to the cemetery . As they pulled up to the gravesite , June saw a green tent with lots of folding chairs underneath , and a metal frame around a hole in the ground . The family gathered around the tent as the pallbearers carried Aunt Martha 's casket to the gravesite and placed it on the frame over the hole . The pastor said a few brief words and prayer again , and then Aunt Martha 's casket was lowered into the ground . The family talked a little while , and then drove over to Aunt Martha 's house to have a wake . There they ate food prepared by a local church for the family , and talked about the good times they had with Aunt Martha when she was alive . Where was Aunt Martha?	in the kitchen	In the casket.

I thought that it would be a fantastic idea to hang a poster of one of my favorite bands , on my bedroom wall . The hardest part was picking which poster I wanted to use . I searched through my items in my storage to find a poster that I thought would fit well with the rest of my room . After looking for awhile I picked a poster of a band called ' The ice monsters ' which was my favorite band during high school . I decided to place it right in the middle of the room , right next to my bed . I got some tape and used it on the back of the poster which I then stuck onto the wall of my room .

I had already put the steak in the oven and was about to begin sautéing the vegetables . I grabbed a knife from our knife block and began to cut the vegetables . I first cut them into equal sized rounds , but those would be too big to bite so I decided to cut them again . I cut each round in half so it was in the shape of a semicircle . I pulled some grape tomatoes out of the refrigerator and put about ten of them on my cutting board . I cut them all in half and poured them into the pan along with my yellow squash and zucchini . Where did they pull these things from?	the refrigerator	the cupboard

First , I had to look over all of the paperwork that was sent to me by the jobs that I had worked for over the past year . The forms told me how much money I had made , and how much I had already paid in taxes . I then had to fill out the actual tax form . I had to read the instructions and make sure that I filled out each box just right , because it is easy to make a mistake . I had to put certain numbers from some boxes in certain places and then do so math to see how much taxes I would have to pay at the end of the year . It was a good year , because the math worked out well , and I ended up getting money back . Now , I am just waiting to get my check so I can go shopping ! When do they send it in the mail?	After they filled out the tax form.	When they get their check.

1709	0,1	0,1	Ok , my shoes are laced up tight , I ’ve got on my shorts , a cool t-shirt and a headband to keep the sweat off my brow . I stood up next to the girl I had come to the park with and said , “ Ok , I ’m ready when you are . ” . Not at a dead run , not even at a sprint . This was a little slower , but faster than walking . “ Oh , we ’re jogging ” I thought to myself as I sped up just a little bit to catch up with the girl . Down the path we jogged , through the trees and past the benches we snaked our way though the park , our shoes clip clopping beneath us . Thankfully the trees with their leaves extending out like happy little jazz fingers blocked most of the suns heat so I was n’t sweating as bad as I was expecting to , but I could n’t help but wonder if this girl every going to run out of breath . Lap after lap we jogged around that park and with each lap I regretted not stretching before we started out . I was amazed at how effortless she was able to glide through the air , with only the slightest hint of sweat glistening off her brow . By this time , shaded by trees or not , our sustained pace around the park had my shirt drenched in sweat . Finally , after two hours of keeping up with her rhythmic pace I could n’t do it any longer and collapsed on the first bench I could find . Exhausted , out of breath and sprawled out on a park bench I look up , and in the glare of the midday light I see her face with a crooked little smirk on it as she says , “ All done with our warm up jog ? ” What was on the path?

1714	0,1	1,0	When I went on vacation last year with my parents , we took a trip on a train for part of it . We picked the route we wanted to take to go visit my uncle , and had everything ready the day before , such as our suitcases . When the day arrived for us to go , my dad drove us to the train station where we parked in a designated lot , since we would be returning to the same train station . We had some extra time , so we wandered around and found a little gift shop where we could buy souvenirs . When it was time to board our train , we walked through the station to get to the correct area . There were long hallways to get there , and then we went up a concrete pathway to where the train was outside . We had to give the ticket taker our tickets so she could verify we were getting on the right train . We stored our luggage and prepared for the train to begin its journey . Once it was time to leave , we watched out the windows at all the passing scenery . After awhile , we all started doing our own thing like reading or playing cards to pass the time . What was a lot of fun?	Train ride	Standing in line

1719	0,1	0,1	It was a cloudy summer day . I woke up early in the morning to check on my indoor plants . I first opened the blinds to see how sunny it was outside , and decided it was a good time to water my indoor plants .  It is important that I water the plants at most twice a week , as it has happened in the past where I added too much water to the pot . Doing so floods the soil of the pot , killing the plant . I carefully measured the water for each plant , so the water does not go above the top of the soil .  I also make sure that the plant can drain the left over water in a plate , so it does not spill on the floor . What do they not want to do when they water?	measure the water for each plant	Flood the soil of the pot

1725	0,1	1,0	There is a wall in my bedroom that I would like to paint . It is the wall beside my bed . Right now the color is blue but I want to change it to green because green is my favorite color . Painting is a messy job so we have to be very careful when we are preparing . I put on my oldest clothes and we get an old bed sheet and spread it out on the floor . I find a paint roller and the tray and put it down on the sheet . Rolling with paint is easier than using a paint brush . It is much faster . I roll the roller in the paint and then start to roll it onto the wall . This is fun ! The blue paint starts to disappear . The green looks really nice . I will have a green wall in my bedroom before I go to sleep tomorrow night . I love painting . What did mom buy?	Paint	Food

I planned a evening to play board games with my kids for over a week . I went to the store and got two new board games and then got some snacks and drinks to eat and drink while we played the board games . It was great to hear the laughter in my children 's voices . Not everyone loved the second board game , it was kind of boring if you ask me . We played the game anyways and after it was finished went back and played the first game that everyone loved . Everyone was very tired and ready for bed . It was a fun night ! What were they playing until am?	board games	cards

I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it , I had found that I did not have any . I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes , and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in . After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers , and chose a heart design that I liked . I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to . When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly 's name and address in the middle , and wrote my sister 's address in the top left corner of the envelope . Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week . I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot . Shelly will be so surprised !

After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers , and chose a heart design that I liked . I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to . When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly 's name and address in the middle , and wrote my sister 's address in the top left corner of the envelope . Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week . I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot . Shelly will be so surprised ! What had a a heart design on it?	The stamp	The envelope

It took a lot of convincing for my husband to hang the painting . He always wants it to be perfect . He found the center of the wall and the stud .

He was very descriptive , and when he told me about how the people in his stories looked I could picture them in my mind . He would say the words that these characters had spoken , and he would make me laugh by imitating the voices of these characters . Some of the stories my grandpa would tell were true , and were stories that had actually happened to him as he traveled long ago . Some of the stories were simply make believe , and I knew they had n't really happened . What was wonderful to him as a boy?	A meal	To listen to his grandfather's stories.

1883	0,1	0,1	A couple years ago , I just started a good , high-paying job and thought it was time to buy a house . I was living in an apartment with my friend , but he was going to be sent to an army base across the country that next year . I drove around my city in search of a house for sale that I would like to move into . There was a sign out front for the realtor , or a person that buys houses so they can sell them to other people , so I called the phone number on the sign and arranged a meeting . The realtor showed me the inside of the house , which they put a lot of work into so it would look extra nice for people that want to buy it . I was very impressed , so a couple weeks later , I met the realtor at the house . A mortgage is basically a type of loan where the bank pays for the house , and in return , they own it and you pay a monthly fee for many years to pay them back . Once you 're done paying , you own the house . A down payment is a large amount of money you pay the realtor to show you 're responsible enough and make enough money to pay for the mortgage . Once we agreed on prices , the realtor had me sign a bunch of papers saying that I 'd pay for the house and follow whatever rules the bank set about what I can do to the house . Once that was done , I made an arrangement with my friend to help pay for his bills until he moved away and I was able to move in to my new house a few weeks later . Where did they find the house?	In the apartment	In the city

She asked me to sit down and she put an apron around me to keep the hair off my dress . Angie and I made small talk while she cut my hair . I wanted a big change , and Angie said she had just the haircut that would be perfect for my face shape . A little anxious at all the hair I said , \ \ Are you trying to test out your new clippers ? \ \ Angie laughed and said , \ \ Almost done hun , all right , there you go . Have a look .

Mostly I wanted to listen to music on my mp3 player so I could take my music with me wherever I would go , for example to the park . My music files are called mp3 audio files and many of the songs I love to listen to are stored on my personal computer . I looked in the file manager of my personal computer to pick out the songs I wanted to listen to . Some songs were classical music , others were rock and roll or country , and there were so many other styles of songs too . Then I attached my mp3 player to my personal computer . After this I copied the mp3 audio files from my personal computer to my mp3 player and then disconnected my mp3 player when I was finished . Later on I listened to the new songs on my mp3 player . When did they choose a few of the songs?	After looking on the computer	Before using the computer

1959	0,1	0,1	It was time to play my favorite game : Trivial Pursuit ! I knew lots of things about lots of things , so this was the perfect game for me . First my parents cleared off the dining room table and I went to the game closet to get the box the game was in .  Setting up was pretty easy . First I pulled out the game board , which was folded up so it would fit in the box . I unfolded it into its circle shape and laid it on the table .  Since it was my parents , my brother , and me , we divided into two teams , so I got out a game piece for each team - green for my parents and yellow for my brother and me .  We put the question cards in their box , grabbed the dice , and sat down around the table , ready to go !  Because we were going to be taking turns , we had to roll the dice to see who would go first .  I rolled a three but my dad rolled a five , so my parents ' team was allowed to go first .  They rolled the dice again and moved their piece , and then my brother and I got to ask them the Trivial Pursuit question .  If they got the question right , they would get to move again .  We played for an hour , taking turns and answering questions while our game pieces collected the different-colored tokens . When my parents asked the last question , my brother and I put our heads together and came up with the right answer , and we won ! They set what on the table?	The food.	the game board

First my parents cleared off the dining room table and I went to the game closet to get the box the game was in .  Setting up was pretty easy . First I pulled out the game board , which was folded up so it would fit in the box . I unfolded it into its circle shape and laid it on the table .  Since it was my parents , my brother , and me , we divided into two teams , so I got out a game piece for each team - green for my parents and yellow for my brother and me .  We put the question cards in their box , grabbed the dice , and sat down around the table , ready to go !  Because we were going to be taking turns , we had to roll the dice to see who would go first .  I rolled a three but my dad rolled a five , so my parents ' team was allowed to go first .  They rolled the dice again and moved their piece , and then my brother and I got to ask them the Trivial Pursuit question .  If they got the question right , they would get to move again .  We played for an hour , taking turns and answering questions while our game pieces collected the different-colored tokens . When my parents asked the last question , my brother and I put our heads together and came up with the right answer , and we won ! Who's turn was it?	the kids had the first turn	The parents had the first turn

If they do n't get water , they start to wither away . Perhaps they turn brown , or grey , or yellow . They shrivel up and die without water . The green will light up your room . Maybe colorful flowers will pop up , too . Water is an important part of life , both for you and your plants .

So every once in a while , my dad will put on these big rubber boots , paired with a windproof jacket , and drive over to the lake near our house . A lot of times , his friends will join him and they will see who catches the biggest fish first . Some days there are no fish , some days he will come home carrying a big lox or something . It is a time commitment , but he loves going fishing . Maybe it is something I will like when I am older . How long will they sit?	a while	for days

I ran upstairs to hold and coddle her , and realized she was n't being soothed . I knew she did n't need a diaper change as I had just changed her before her nap and her diaper felt dry . I realized she must be hungry . I brought her and the bottle to the couch , sat her on my lap , and brought the nipple of the bottle to her lips . The baby suckled onto the bottle and I could hear her sucking in the milk . After a few minutes , she released her lips from the nipple , indicating to me that she had had enough to eat .

2046	0,1	1,0	I recently purchased a new camera and I really love it . I spent a long time taking pictures with it , so the batteries needed to be replaced after just a few days . In order to replace them so I could take more pictures , I first opened the battery compartment to double check which size I would need . After figuring that part out , I put the lid back on the battery compartment and went to the store to purchase the batteries . When I got home from the store I opened the package of batteries and slid them into the camera , one by one . I slid the battery compartment lid closed , then turned the camera on to see if everything worked . When the screen of the camera lit up I knew that I had done a good job .

2053	0,1	1,0	Last night , I decided to cook pasta for dinner . I had a few different varieties in my pantry to choose from - angelhair , spaghetti , linguine , rotini , penne , and shells . I decided to make the linguine . While I waited for the pot of water to boil , I grated some parmesan cheese . Once the water came to a boil , I emptied the box of linguine into the pot . I stirred the linguine so that it would not stick together . Then I placed the linguine into a pan on the stove over medium heat . To create a simple sauce , I drizzled some olive oil over the pasta , and added a tablespoon of butter to the pan . I then added freshly ground pepper and the parmesan cheese I grated earlier . I stirred the ingredients together . What was the large pot filled with?	water	cheese

2067	0,1	0,1	One of my favorite daily activities is my evening walks . This is because I get to go for the walk with my two dogs . Before we go on our walk , I have to put on their harnesses and leashes . Once they are in their harnesses , we head to the elevator so we can go downstairs and leave our apartment building . They are always so excited to go on our walks . We have a few different routes and we take our time at first , walking slowly so they can relieve themselves and sniff around . We will walk for about 20 minutes before we turn around to head home . The exercise is good for me and my dogs and we are all tired by the time we get home . I will get them out of their harnesses and I will take off my sneakers . Finally we all collapse on the couch and relax , feeling good after a nice evening walk . How long does it take to take the leashes off the hook by the door?	10 minutes	a few seconds

2069	0,1	0,1	I went with my friend John to the playground . There were jungle gyms , swings , and rocking animals and see-saws . We decided to ride the rocking animals first , because those were the easiest to access . The animals were very fun to ride , but after a while I got a little dizzy and decided to try out the jungle gyms . The jungle gyms were hard to climb and I got tired very quickly , but I made it to the top just when I thought I would not be able to grip them with my hands . I then went with my friend John to the swings , because those were a little bit easier to use . I had a hard time starting up and so I backed up a little bit so that I could swing back and forth .

I set one half down and too the other into the palm of my hand . Holding it not to tight and not to loose I pushed it down onto the slotted metal cone in the juicer . As I turned and pushed , bright orange liquid squirted into the pitcher . When it seemed like no more juice would come , I tossed the peal in the compost and picked up the other half . I grabbed a glass and poured myself a drink before putting the rest of the juice in the fridge . What did they cut with the knife?	orange	juicer

2080	0,1	0,1	Over the last year , it happened on several occasions where an aunt of mine was n't able to secure a babysitter for her month old son , so she would ask me if I was willing to watch him while she went to work .

2089	0,1	0,1	Sunday . Chore day . Not my favorite thing to do , and today I had decided to tackle the bathroom . First , I wiped down the sides of the tub , which for some reason always seem to collect blue lint from my towels . Then I ran the water in the tub to rinse down the bits of dirt and sand that were lingering in the back of the tub . Since I have short hair , thankfully I did n't have to pull hair out of the drain , like I sometimes had to do when I had roommates . I pulled the bathmat out of the tub and grabbed a sponge from under the sink . I wet the sponge and poured shower cleaner onto it . Then I knelt down and scrubbed the bottom and sides of the tub , running the water to rinse everything down . Then I rinsed out the sponge and ran it over the walls to clean them , although they were not as dirty . I left the fan running while the tub dried out but turned off the light and left the room . What did they ring out?	Their hair	the sponge

2093	0,1	1,0	Today me and my friend decided to plant flowers . The way we started was by going to the home and garden store to buy the seeds . After we picked out our seeds , we also had to buy gardening tools . The flower I picked out was a marigold , because I love the color yellow . There are flowers of all colors though ! When we planted the flowers , we dug a small hole and put one seed in each spot . We made sure to put about a foot of distance between each seed . In one week , we had some small sprouts , and in three weeks of watering we had full flowers ! We cut the flowers when they were fully grown and I gave one to my mom . She loved it and put it in a vase ! Gloves and scissors were purchased, along with what else?	seeds/shovel	plants

The kids and I all like ham , so I made three ham and cheese sandwiches and wrapped them in sandwich bags . I packed a reusable container with some cut melon we had the night before and grabbed a couple bags of individually sized potato chips .

2117	0,1	1,0	Yesterday , I did some online banking . The bank I use has the option to do deposits and withdrawals over the internet , so since I did n't have time to go to the bank , I decided to do a withdrawal online .

2122	0,1	0,1	Last year my husband and I attended a community theater production of `` Man of La Mancha '' . It was held at a very nice modern theater that is part of a community center in a nearby town . I enjoy the music in `` Man of La Mancha '' very much . The play started at 8:00 p.m. and since there were no reserved seats , we left early . We drove in our car to the theater . We arrived at 7:30 . They gave us a program which contained a lot of information about the play , the actors and production crew , and the community theater company in general . We read that program until the play started . When the lights went down in the `` house '' -LRB- which is what they call the audience part of the theater , where you sit -RRB- , an orchestra began to play . The music at the beginning is called `` the overture . '' They played the overture for about five minutes . Then the curtain went up and the play began . There was some dancing , and as this was a play about Don Quixote and Sancho Panza , the two main characters rode `` pretend '' horses which were like boxes around their waists but you could see their legs underneath . `` Man of La Mancha '' is a funny story with a sad ending because Don Quixote -LRB- really the author Miguel de Cervantes -RRB- goes to prison . There was an intermission in the middle of the performance where they stopped the action , put the lights on in the `` house '' -LRB- where the audience sits -RRB- , and we went out into the lobby of the theater to buy a Coke . We knew the play was over when the stage curtain was lowered for the final time . The curtain did go up again , one more time , as the actors came out onstage and we applauded them . We had also applauded them after every song during the play . Then the house lights went up for the final time , we left the theater , got into our car and went home . When did they talk about the songs they liked?	on the way to the theater	after the play

2222	0,1	0,1	Tonight for dinner I wanted to have pasta . I got out my pot and filled it with water . I added a few tablespoons of salt to the water so it would boil faster .

2262	0,1	0,1	I bought tickets with my best friends for a football game at our college in September . As soon as I bought the tickets , I realized that the game was far from where I lived and that I would need to buy a plane ticket since it was too far to drive my car . I opened up my computer and looked up the name of the airline I usually fly with .

The library was obviously closed and nobody was inside and no lights were on .  I was upset by this and I called 911 to report a crime in progress . The operator from 911 took my information and asked me to describe what I was seeing . After about ten minutes two county police officers showed up in separate cars and one officer went to each door of the library .  The officers called the parents of the teenagers and then arrested them for their crime . After a little while one of the officers came over to talk to me and then let me leave . When did the teenagers break into the library?	evening	After calling 911

To prepare for the barbecue I went shopping at the grocery store for hamburgers , hotdogs , rolls , chips , salad and soda . When I returned from the store I prepared the salads and laid all of the food out to be cooked on the grill . As my friends began to arrive one of them volunteered to cook all of the food while the rest of us socialized and played volley ball . As the food was prepared we all enjoyed eating a burger or hot dog and then we quickly returned to playing different lawn games such as croquet and horseshoes . We really had a fun afternoon and I am excited to host a few more barbecues this summer . Where did the friends decide to go?	To the beach	over to their beach house
2281	0,1	0,1	Last night , while getting ready for bed , I walked through the kitchen and instantly noticed my feet were getting wet . Looking down in horror I realized my toddler had spilled milk everywhere . Grabbing the towel I have hanging from the oven door , I was able to step on that to then reach paper towels . Once it was good enough , I then grabbed my mop and the mop bucket . From the kitchen sink I filled the bucket and added a little soap . Dunking the mop in the bucket and then moving it across the floor to pick up any remaining mess . Once done , I emptied the bucket and hung the mop up to dry . The floors dried overnight without any extra help . I was able to sleep until tomorrow brings a whole new set up messes . Who do they live with now?	mother	The toddler.

We were all excited to have a party because this is an event we all attend every year , however this year we were unsure of the weather . After checking the weather the day before the event , we realized that we would have to cancel the party due to thunderstorms . Our house is too small to have a party inside , hence we could only have a party in our back yard . If people did not confirm that they had seen the email , then we went about sending them a text message or called them via phone until we got responses from everyone , so they knew we were not having a party . How did they notify everyone of the cancellation?	went about sending them a text message or called them	With flyers

It has some fun songs like " My Favorite Things " and Sixteen Going on Seventeen " . Now that I have decided , I must make sure the compact disc player is plugged into the electric socket and is turned on . Both of those things have been done .

2333	0,1	1,0	Last week on a bike ride to my friends house , I was traveling on a very rough road with a lot of rocks on the side of it . I realized after about 10 minutes into my ride that I had a very bad flat tire . Thankfully I carry the proper tools and items with me to fix it . After removing the tire and the tube inside , I used my tools to put a brand new tube inside of the tire . I checked it to make sure that I had aligned everything correctly and after ensuring that I did , I placed the tire back onto the bike . I then used my portable pump to make sure that I had the proper amount of air pressure inside of it , because I did n't want another flat . It was an easy fix . When did they pull off the road?	after the flat tire occurred	after arriving friend's house

2360	0,1	0,1	My son went on his first Cub Scout fishing trip this year . He borrowed a fishing rod from one of the other scouts . The scout leader had dug some worms to use as bait , and they also brought some canned corn for bait . But he still had to be very careful not to hurt himself on the sharp hook . They were fishing from a bridge over a river , so he had to wait until no-one was walking by before he cast his line into the water . One of the scout leaders showed him how to cast so that the line spins out and sends the hook far into the water , then to slowly reel it in and wait for a fish to bite . There was a red-and-white bobber on the line that floated on the surface of the water until a fish bit the hook , then it bobbed to let him know he 'd caught something ! He gave the line a tug to make sure the fish was firmly on the hook , then he reeled in his line - and , sure enough , there was a nice fat pumpkinseed fish on the end of his hook ! When was corn used?	after the boys were done fishing	When fishing.

2428	0,1	0,1	There 's a football , or soccer as we call it in America , team in my city called Real Salt Lake . Two weeks ago , I went to a match with my brother . First , I made sure we had tickets by buying them on the team 's website . On the day of the match , I picked up my brother from the train station . After that , we drove to the stadium where the game was being played . There were lots of people going to the game , so it took us longer than we thought because of the traffic on the way . When we got to the stadium about 30 minutes before the game , we paid a stadium worker ten dollars so we could park in the parking lot . Here , we showed another worker our tickets . We walked through a metal detector so the stadium workers could make sure we were not carrying anything bad like a gun . From there , we looked at the signs to find the right place to enter the stadium and find our seats . There was a lot of exciting action . We decided not to get snacks or drinks at the stadium because they cost a lot of money . The crowd around us cheered the whole game , especially when our team was about to score . We had a lot of fun . After a bit of waiting in traffic to leave the parking lot , I drove my brother back home . When did they print tickets so that they would be let into the match?	after the game	before the match

We did n't have to tackle each other like I 'd seen them do on T.V. but just tag each other to be out . Then we started the game . I found out a football is awkward to hold and throw . It 's not round like other balls , but shaped long with pointed ends . When I tried to pass it to another player , it wobbled all over and did n't go where I wanted it to .

2439	0,1	0,1	Winter does n’t like to give way to Spring in our part of the country . It keeps trying to keep the weather too cold for planting . But soon the weather will go from chill to hot and it is time to start getting the flowers germinated . I dig out my large pots , buy potting soil and pick out flowers that will best thrive in our area of the country . Once home , I clean up the pots from the year before and add a few pieces of gravel before filling them with the new , soft potting soil . I ’ve chosen a variety of flowers that work together . I spread them in a semi-circle inside the pots . I set up a narrow table in front of a back window with lots of sun . I top it with a plastic cloth for spills and arrange the pots . Over the next days and a couple of weeks , I watch the plants stick their heads above ground . With water and sunlight , they gain strength and height until they are hardy enough to survive in the outside garden . By then the weather is warm . Why did they make sure not to make piles of seeds?	so the plants will die	for the plants to breathe

2452	0,1	1,0	I was spending some time with my friends at the beach and it was starting to get cold . Since we wished to stay for a while yet , we decided that we wanted to build a bonfire . My friends and I set out to explore the area and see what we could find in order to create a bonfire . We also picked up a bunch of newspapers and other assorted paper items that people had left lying around . We then headed into the forest area near the beach and picked up a bunch of leaves and scattered plant remnants . We carried all of these items back to the place where we had set up our chairs and other gear and then we assembled it all into a large pile . My friend doused it all with some lighter fluid and , being careful to stand back from the pile , we tossed a match onto it . What would be good kindling for fire?	a bunch of newspapers and other assorted paper items, a bunch of leaves and scattered plant remnants	chairs

2461	0,1	0,1	I look around at the wall in my house , and think it is a little empty .

2470	0,1	0,1	It was a beautiful summer night , and my sister and I decided to make a bonfire . We went outside to see if we had enough firewood and discovered that we did n't have enough wood for our fire . I decided to go out into the forest to pick up some more wood while my sister used the wood we had to get a fire started .  Once I had gathered a decent amount of firewood , I went back to find my sister and see how the fire was coming . She had gotten a pretty good start but the fire definitely needed some more wood . I took the branches I had gathered them and made them into a teepee formation on top of the fire my sister had started .  We enjoyed our night out by the fire and cooked some hot dogs and made s'mores at the end of the night . What was the first thing listed that they picked up?	bonfire	firewood

2494	0,1	1,0	Last night I learned how to play a new board game . This board game is called " Jenga " . The way my friends taught me to play is to set up the whole tower , with 3 blocks going one way , and then 3 blocks going the other way all the way until you 're at the top . Each person has to try to take a block out of the tower , and if the tower falls when you 're trying to take a block out you lose ! It gets pretty nerve-wracking when you 're trying to take a block out and it feels like the whole tower is about to fall down . After about ten turns the Jenga tower started wobbling , and the whole thing came crumbling down at the 12th turn ! I was so glad it was n't my turn it fell at . When did people play?	Last night	tonight

2565	0,1	1,0	My family and I get our clothes very wet sometimes . We get caught in the rain . Or our clothes get wet when we clean them . When my mom has to dry the clothes for the family , she first puts them in the clothes dryer . She opens the door of the clothes dryer and throws them in . The clothes dryer is a special machine in my family 's house meant for drying clothes . After my mom puts the clothes in the clothes dryer , she closes the door and turns the knob on top . The knob on top controls how long the clothes dryer runs . She then goes to do other important things and lets the clothes dryer run for the amount of time she set with the knob . She opens the door to look at the clothes . She checks to see if the clothes are really fully dry or not ( sometimes the clothes dryer does n't make them fully dry the first time ) . If the clothes are still wet , my mom puts the clothes back in the clothes dryer . If the clothes are dry , my mom takes the clothes out of the clothes dryer .

2574	0,1	1,0	Today I decided to wash my hair . Before washing my hair , I made sure to gather everything that I would need . I got together my favorite shampoo , conditioner , leave-in conditioner & a towel . First , I put hair head under the shower head & let water saturate all of my hair . Then , once my hair is wet , I add a dime sized amount of shampoo to my hand & apply it to my hair , focusing on my scalp . Once it it all bubbly & feels clean , I rinse it out . After that , I apply a generous amount of conditioner so my hair does n't dry out from the shampoo . After that , I rinse it out with lukewarm water so my hair absorbs & locks in all of the good ingredients . Afterwards , I get out of the shower , towel-dry my hair & apply leave-in conditioner so my hair will stay moisturized . Then , I proceed with styling . When did they wash their hair while in the shower?	After the hair gets really wet.	after the shower

2654	0,1	0,1	Yesterday morning , I took a shower . I started by bringing in my change of clothes , as it is always more convenient to change after the shower than it is to walk all the way over to my room to do it . I tend to let the shower water run first so that it can heat up , and I spend that time brushing my teeth . Once I 'm done , I place my towel at the end of the shower opposite of the shower head . Typically , I 'll stay under the hot water for quite a few minutes , as a shower is really my only means of relaxation . Sometimes I 'll use soap , but soap is something that is n't as necessary as people think it is , so I try not to use that too often . And after a lengthy amount of time rinsing off , I simply allow myself to stand there after turning the shower water off , thinking about the day ahead of me and whatever other thoughts ran through my mind during the shower . And then , I get out of the shower , dry off , and get dressed . What will happen to the shampoo in the hair?	it will catch fire	it is rubbed into the scalp and then rinsed off

I 've decided to move the recliner to the other side of the room so we can put the Christmas tree in front of the window . People will be able to see it from the sidewalk and it will be very pretty at night ! Before I can put up the tree , I 'll need to move the sofa over toward the wall and put the coffee table in front of it . Once the space in front of the window is empty , I will put the Christmas tree there and decorate it . Moving furniture is hard work , but I only have to do it once in a while and it 's nice to try new arrangements . I 'll need to move all the furniture again after Christmas ! Towards what was the recliner moved to?	In front of the window.	The other side of the room.

The event has largely become popular for how often people meet new romantic partners at the dance . I arrived at town hall around dusk along with a few friends of mine . We were all very sharply dressed . We went inside and the music was already bumping . I noticed a few women alone in the crowd , seemingly looking for partners . I danced with a few different people throughout the night , but at around midnight I saw her . She was alone on the edge of the dance floor , and she looked so beautiful . When did they meet the love of their life?	When they arrived.	At around midnight.

I was lucky that I found the button after it fell off and did not need a replacement button . All I needed was a needle and thread .  I found my sewing kit in the closet and opened it up to find that I had many options of what color thread to use .  I decided to go with black thread to match the color of the original thread used in the other buttons on the shirt .  I went with a medium sized needle . I threaded the needle and then proceeded to place the button on the shirt and sew it back on . Once I was done , I cut the excess thread off . What was done with the button?	they took it to a store to find a match	it was sewed back on

2729	0,1	0,1	I found a beautiful little tree at the local nursery and brought it home to plant in my garden . I had already picked the spot it was to go , a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun . After gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves , I set to work on digging the hole .  I dampened the soil in the hole with a little water . Once the hole was ready , I laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it . I placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots .  I think this little tree will make a wonderful addition to my yard ! What was watered once more?	garden	the soil

2733	0,1	1,0	My friends Anna , Gary , Joe and Tina all asked me to set up a weekly board game evening because we love to play them together but can never seem to meet up on a regular basis . I agreed to do so because I like to organize events . The first thing I did was ask everyone who was willing to host the evening and , if they were willing , how much space did they have to fit us ? Two friends said that they would be willing to host : Anna , who had a small 1-bedroom apartment with a small kitchen we could play our game in ; and Gary , who had a house with a basement that had plenty of room as well as a kitchen for easy access to snacks . I called Gary to make sure that he wanted to host the evening and after he said yes , I texted everyone in the group to let them know where the board game evening would be held . Then it was time to pick the board game for that upcoming evening . The group said it was up to me to chose , so I chose a game that all of us had mentioned : One Night Ultimate Werewolf . I put the board game on a table by my front door so I would n't lose it before the evening happened . Once I picked the location and the board game , I texted all my friends to let them know who should break snacks . I told Anna and Joe to bring a few cheap pizzas , then I told Gary to stock the fridge with drinks . After I had everything planned , I texted everyone to ask them if meeting at 6 PM on Saturday would work for them . Everyone answered that Saturday at 6 PM was fine , and I was done planning our board game evening . Whose house did they choose?	Gary's house	Anna's
2734	0,1	1,0	A few weeks ago I decided that it was time for me to get a hair cut . Normally it is recommended to get a hair cut every six months , but I had gone quite a bit longer . The ends of my hair were splitting , and my bangs were getting longer than I liked them to be . I decided to go back to Great Clips , which is a chain that has a location near where I live . They do not require an appointment , although you can check-in online ahead of time , so I decided to walk in . I drove to the location and found a parking place easily , and there was only one or two other customers there at the time . I walked in and gave my name , and they had a record of what I had done at my previous visits . She said that she could start right away and led me to a section where I could leave my phone and wallet . I put those down , and followed her over to the chair for the shampoo . It was very relaxing and did not take much time . I explained I just wanted about an inch taken off of most of my hair , but my bangs to be cut so they were more above my eyes again . We did n't really talk much while she was cutting my hair , and it took her less than ten minutes . I did not want my hair blow dried , so she left it wet . I went back to the front of the shop with her to pay , and I also made sure to leave her a tip . Where did they leave after the haircut?	Great Clips	their home

2816	0,1	1,0	I bought a present to take to my friend 's birthday party . I need to wrap my gift in pretty paper so my friend will not know what her gift is until she unwraps it . I will also need to buy some tape to seal the folds and edges of my wrapped gift . I only had wrapping paper left over from Christmas . This paper had reindeer and Santas on it . I go to the store to look for paper . It is very pretty and my friend 's favorite color is pink . The paper is wrapped around a cardboard tube . When I unroll the paper at home , I lay my gift on the paper and cut a square out that is big enough to wrap around the present . I do the same with the ends of the paper . Soon my present is completely covered and hidden under the pretty , pink paper and looks very beautiful . Finally , I tape a large , ruffled pink bow to the middle of the package . She decides to unwrap her gift slowly , instead of tearing the paper off . She saves the paper to use again on someone else 's present . My friend is completely surprised when she finds hiding underneath the paper is a jewelry box ! Both my friend and I are happy . What was their friend delighted with?	gift	cardboard tube

2825	0,1	0,1	In my high-school senior class we have home economics and this week they taught us how to sew pillows and clothes . Though I was nervous and did n't think I could do it , the teacher insisted I learn . The first thing I was taught is to select a thread that closely matches the color of your clothing . So since my shirt was dark blue , I selected a navy blue thread and carefully placed it through the eye of the needle . Next , I inserted the needle through the hole in my shirt and stitched it to the closest piece of fabric . Then , I pulled the needle snugly and tied the thread safely so the hole was closed for good . I was so happy and proud of myself for fixing my shirt , and thanked the teacher for showing me how to sew my clothes ! What needed to be closed?	button hole	hole in shirt

2831	0,1	0,1	Sunday , my husband and I did our grocery shopping . He had a shopping list recorded in his cell phone . We arrived at the store in the early afternoon , and the first thing we did was get a shopping cart . My husband checked the list . We only had bananas on the list , but I said we should get things for salad , too , so he picked out bananas and bell peppers while I got lettuce and radishes and tomatoes . Then we went to the deli area and ordered some sliced turkey . The man behind the counter sliced the turkey for us and measured it on a scale to give us the amount we wanted , then wrapped it up for us . Next we visited the bakery area and picked out a nice loaf of rye bread to put the turkey on . In the canned goods area , we picked out soup and white beans ; then we went to the pasta area to get pasta and sauce . Then we went to the dairy refrigerators and we each picked out some flavors of yogurt we like , and got milk and butter and eggs . We were nearly done , so my husband checked the list again and we saw we had forgotten tin foil and toilet paper , so we went back and got those two things . Then we went to the check-out where we put all our groceries on a conveyor belt and the clerk scanned each item in an electronic scanner to find out what it cost . Meanwhile , a bagger was putting our groceries into re-usable shopping bags that we had brought with us . He put the bags back into the cart . We got a receipt from the clerk and pushed the cart out to our car , where we moved the bags into the back seat . Then my husband put the cart in little corral in the parking lot that keeps the carts away from people 's cars , and we got in our car and went home . When did they pay?

2832	0,1	0,1	Sunday , my husband and I did our grocery shopping . He had a shopping list recorded in his cell phone .

2839	0,1	0,1	Today I had to lock up the house . I was at home with my family , and since it was getting late I decided it would be safest to lock the doors before bed . The way I did this was by first making sure everyone was home , and then going to each door and making sure the door locks were all working correctly . Using a two lock system helps insure my family 's safety and my own safety . I was glad I could do this because sometimes at night , robberies happen in my neighborhood . I had been hearing a lot about this on the local news , so it gave me peace of mind to be able to securely lock each door before we went to sleep . After what did they lock each door?	going to sleep	making sure the door locks were working correctly

2847	0,1	1,0	I was traveling on vacation a few months ago , and decided to take a train to my destination instead of flying . I have always wanted to travel by train , and this was a good opportunity . I went online to look at the train schedules . There were quite a lot of them , so it took me a while to narrow down my choices based on when I wanted to leave and then arrive at my vacation destination . I finally was able to choose a time and date , and I purchased my tickets with my credit card . I went to the train station and checked in with the railway . They gave me a paper ticket , which I then brought to the rail line . When we boarded the train , we gave the ticket to a ticket taker , and he escorted me to my booth . Finally after all the passengers were on board , we were off . The train seemed a bit jerky in the motion , but eventually it smoothed out . It was so much fun , seeing all of the towns and cities we passed through . People would get on and off when we stopped . I was able to purchase some food in a car that sold sandwiches . I slept some in my car , which was a bit uncomfortable , but I did n't mind . I was really glad that I had taken a train , and was able to see a lot of our beautiful country . When would the vacation take place?	a few months ago	A few days ago.

2852	0,1	0,1	The day had finally come : I was going on a bike tour ! But first I had to put on my protective gear . I was already dressed to go out , so now I put on sunscreen and some bug spray , then added my knee-pads , elbow-pads , helmet , and the reflective neon vest I wore so people could see me more easily from their cars . I wanted to go to the park and ride through it , so I would definitely need water and some snacks , too . I packed two water bottles into my bike basket , then I grabbed my snacks : a bag of trail mix , a bag of crackers , and two chocolate-flavored protein bars . I also put my wallet and my phone in my pocket , in case I ran into any emergencies . After double-checking to make sure I had everything I needed , I walked my bike out of the garage and climbed aboard . I knew exactly where I needed to go ! I biked through my neighborhood , enjoying the warm air and pretty scenery all around me . I made sure to check for cars whenever I crossed the street , too . Finally , I arrived at the park . It was beautiful , and I rode my bike slowly through all the green grass and flowers and trees , enjoying the shade and the nice smells and the sound of birds . This was why I liked riding my bike and going on bike tours : so I could enjoy being out in nature . What a wonderful outing . Where did they bike through the park?	The neighborhood	through all the green grass and flowers and trees
2853	0,1	0,1	I made salmon the other night to eat with a cesar salad . I bought a pound of fresh , wild , Alaskan sockeye salmon at the fish counter at the grocery store and asked for them to remove the skin for me . I squeezed several lemons into a shallow bowl and put the salmon in the lemon juice , I let it soak for five minutes then flipped it and let it soak for another five minutes . I sprayed an iron skillet with cooking spray and sat the salmon in the skillet . I put the salmon in the oven for five minutes , removed it and flipped it and put it back in the oven for another five minutes . When I pulled the salmon out it looked done so I squeezed the juice of another lemon on it and put it onto a plate . I let the salmon sit for a few minutes to cool down and then cut it up into bite size pieces which I sprinkled on top of romaine lettuce and parmesan cheese . The salmon was perfectly cooked . Why was the oven preheated?	to make the salad	to cook the fish

I bought a pound of fresh , wild , Alaskan sockeye salmon at the fish counter at the grocery store and asked for them to remove the skin for me . I squeezed several lemons into a shallow bowl and put the salmon in the lemon juice , I let it soak for five minutes then flipped it and let it soak for another five minutes . I sprayed an iron skillet with cooking spray and sat the salmon in the skillet . I put the salmon in the oven for five minutes , removed it and flipped it and put it back in the oven for another five minutes . When I pulled the salmon out it looked done so I squeezed the juice of another lemon on it and put it onto a plate . I let the salmon sit for a few minutes to cool down and then cut it up into bite size pieces which I sprinkled on top of romaine lettuce and parmesan cheese . The salmon was perfectly cooked . when did the person use dressing?	before eating their salad	after the dishes were washed

We 've decided to review movies from both of our perspectives to share with others so they may decide what they 'd like to see . After we go to the movies , we both discuss our opinions and what we did and did n't like about the movies . Then we get to work to share our views with others on the internet in the form of movie reviews . We will both sit down at the computer and type out two different opinions based on the movie plot , acting and what we both enjoyed and did not enjoy . So far the feedback has been mixed , I am glad we get to do something like this together and share our opinions with others . Why do they share the reviews?	to make sure everyone follows their opinion	so others may decide

You can make them get different careers , get married , and have babies . The Sims does have cheat codes that I often access , so that I do n't have to spend a lot of time having them go to work , etc . I know it 's bad but I think it is entertaining and dramatic . I can only really play for a few hours before it gets boring , but I really like the fact that I can change up the houses and make friendships . Playing the game really helps me escape reality for a few hours and helps ease my anxiety sometimes . When do they wreck the Sim's family/marriage?	before playing the Sims video game	when playing

We asked the landlord and they said it would be just fine to replace it with something better . We spent a couple of days to steam the wallpaper from the walls . It took a while but we had a clean wall after that . At that point , we shopped around for a wallpaper that we would really like for that room . After we bought our wallpaper , we brought it down to the basement room we were papering . We were careful to not allow any air bubbles to stay . We pressed the wallpaper on and left it to dry .

I was embarrassed by this set up , but it was better than not dating at all . My sister said we would go see a movie at the local cinema on Saturday at 6PM . On Saturday I was so excited and started getting ready very early . My sister told me to calm down that i was getting ready way too soon . So I took off my clothes and put on something different . Finally the time came to get ready and I was excited again . He was so handsome ! By 5:00 we were at the ice cream shop where we met up with her boyfriend and had ice cream . Then we went to the movies . We munched , drank and watched the movie . Once it was over we went to the mall and ate at the food court and went and played video games at the arcade . Around 10 PM we were ready to leave . She dropped him off at his house about 10:15 and he gave me a peck on the cheek . My sister raised her eyebrow but did n't say anything . Around 10:30 we showed up to our house where my mom wanted to know everything that went on . Except maybe the kiss . Where did they leave at 4:30?	Their house.	The mall.

We bought the tickets online last week and had to pick them up from a kiosk outside the theater when we arrived . Then we stood in line waiting to get in for about ten minutes , and finally it was our turn . We walked over to the area in front of the stage and picked a nice spot out to watch the concert from . There were many people there and we were glad we 'd gotten there early enough to get a great spot near the stage . It was getting dark when suddenly a lot of bright colored lights came on and the band walked out on the stage . The concert lasted two hours and we had a great time . When it was over , we made our way back to our car in the parking lot and went home . It was a night we 'll never forget . Where was the man standing when they gave him their tickets?	in front of the people	at the stage

Boy were they surprised that day . The center hiked the ball to the quarterback who was responsible for calling the plays and handing or passing the ball off to other players as we moved down the field to our end zone for a score . The first play the quarterback passed the ball to my sister and she took off down the field for a touch down . None of the boys on the other team could keep up with her . The boys on the other team were grumbling about how they were not going to take it easy on them any more .

3021	0,1	1,0	Just recently , it was Christmas time . Obviously , with Christmas time comes the task of getting presents for family . This is what I did . I went online and bought gifts for all of my family members , but of course , I was n't going to just put the gifts under the Christmas tree just like that . I went out and bought some of the nicest looking wrapping paper I could find , along with some tape , bows , name tags , and scissors . Next , I put whichever gifts that were n't already in boxes into some boxes , and I closed them up with tape . I needed to roll out the right amount of wrapping paper to fit around the box completely , and cut it loose from the rest of the roll . Then , I needed to fold the corners so there was no loose paper sticking out , and tape the wrapping paper closed . After the boxes were completely wrapped , I put on a name tag for whoever the gift was for , and a bow to top it all off . What was being wrapped?	gifts	birthday presents

3032	0,1	0,1	One week ago , I was on Amazon shopping for birthday presents for myself . I was looking for electronics like maybe a Fitbit Surge , Blaze , or Charge . I was not sure if I wanted a Charge 1 or 2 . Overall , I decided to go with Amazon because I have some gift cards for that website that I have not been able to use for a long time . Well , I have more than some gift cards per se . I have about $ 400 that I am trying to get rid of . I like the Fitbit Charge 2 best of all because it has a clock feature and is not too expensive . If I get this Fitbit instead of a cheaper one than I might not need to get myself a normal watch for my wrist later on either . Where did they check besides craigslist, backpage, ebay, and jet?	The Fitbit website	Amazon

3052	0,1	0,1	The most important thing about telling a story is understanding your audience . Then , you can tailor the story to their interests . For instance , I was asked to tell a story to a class of first graders . Most little children really like animals and they like hearing about animals doing unusual , even impossible things . They like to use their imaginations , and hear others using their imaginations also . So I sat on the floor with the children and told them a story of a small dog that was never taken seriously by the big dogs , and how the dog saved them all when the dogcatcher came . It 's also important to know the right language that will be understood by your audience , so I was sure to use words that 6 year olds would understand . I also kept the story to just about 8 minutes knowing kids that age do n't want to sit still for a long time . When did they ask themselves what do first graders like?	After story time	before their story

I walked out to the livingroom and looked at the piano . While i was watching it , I could see the piano keys being pressed down . What I could not see is who or what was pressing the piano keys down . The notes did not play a tune at all . It was all just a bunch of crazy notes , there was no song at all . I walked towards the piano while it played a crazy tune no one could recognize . I reached to lift the back cover and look into the piano . As I lifted the lid , I could see , looking back at me ; was a tiny pair of eyes . It was a tiny , gray mouse making the piano go plink , plink . I carefully caught the little mouse . I named him Mozart after the famous composer . What was making the sound?	a mouse in the piano	a ghost

3069	0,1	0,1	The local YMCA is offering free swimming classes . I decided to give it a try , since I am not a great swimmer . The first class was at 9 am on a Monday morning . I arrived and put on my bathing suit and went into the pool with the rest of the class and the instructor . Then we learned to float , by laying on our backs and relaxing . Now , I was ready for the next lesson . The instructor went to us each individually and taught us some basic strokes and had us practice . I tried the doggie paddle and did well . Next , I attempted the free style and had some difficulty but eventually I got the hang of it and so did the other students . Hopefully , tomorrow I will learn the breaststroke and be ready for the Olympics in no time . Who was doing the teaching?	the author	the instructor

Reaching inside I pulled out the tools I 'd need , needle , thread , scissors , and a new button which thankfully matched the other ones . I found a quiet corner to sit down in and settled on the ground with the shirt spread open in my lap . I studied the button for a moment , noticing that it had four tiny holes in the middle of its face . I pulled the thread through the eye of the needle , getting it through the first time , then knotted the other end . I carefully placed my needle on the inside of the shirt where the old button used to be and pushed it through the fabric , making sure the needle went through one of the button 's little holes too . Pulling the thread tight I pushed the needle back through a different hole on the button and through the fabric . Over and over I moved the needle in and out of the button holes , making a little x with my thread until the x felt nice and thick . I pulled the needle through one last time so that it was on the inside of the shirt , took it off of the thread and knotted the thread end right next to the fabric . I was going to get to wear this shirt after all . What did the person secure?	The person secured a shirt button.	The person secured a jacket button.

We planned this event months and months in advance , they were all going to fly in and we were all going to stay in a hotel type thing for a couple days and have a party . I was in charge of setting the party up because I live in this city so I know everything well , and I work in a place that gives great hotel discounts . It seemed like as the time got closer , everyone had a reason as to why they could n't show up . You name it , the excuse was given . I told everyone to just not bother coming , in that case . What did the person cancel?	The day of the party	family reunion

I practiced on a stuffed animal bear before I used the scissors on my own hair . After that , I looked at myself in the mirror and put my bangs between my pointer and middle fingers just like a hairdresser would do . Next , I took the scissors and gave my bangs a trim . Little did I realize I had school pictures that week for my preschool class . While funny now , my mother did not find so much humor in the event at the time .

I bought and packed up a first aid kit , sunscreen and bug spray , needle nose pliers , a few different lures , some plastic worms , a few sinkers and bobbers , some hooks and fishing line and of course my brand new fishing pole . I did n't think I was ready to deal with real worms or anything too complicated so I 'm glad there was a plastic option ! I got everything set up in my spot at the lake and waited to see the bobber go up and down to let me know I had a fish on the line . Every time I go I 'll gain more experience and start catching bigger fish ! What were all pretty small?	fishes caught	fishes in the lake

I had to wait with a group of people for the train to arrive , but it did n't take very long . When the train got to my station the doors slowly slid open and everyone walked inside .

So I contacted my and my fiance 's friends and asked them to bring any board games they could think of that they have at home . One friend had pie face , a new game he had n't tried before , but the box looked hilarious . Another friend has Jenga , which is n't really a board game , but it 's still a socially active day . Pretty much everyone is looking forward to this day because it 's so different and laid back from other wedding receptions theyve been too , which were too stuffy and formal , except one friend who was n't too interested in the idea , but I got her to come around by involving her in the wedding decor and makeup stuff .

3163	0,1	0,1	It was pouring outside , and I needed to get across the city fast for a job interview . I knew that hailing a cab would be much more difficult than normal due to the rain . I stood on the curb waving my arm from under my umbrella for what seemed like an eternity . In all actuality , it was probably only two minutes , but the cold , wet air seemed to slow time down immensely . Finally , a cab stopped to pick me up . I quickly got in and made sure to shake my umbrella out before lowering it into the car so that I did not get the floor wet . The cab driver asked where I wanted to go , and I informed him that I had a job interview in twenty minutes sixteen blocks over . He said , `` That 's going to be a tight squeeze on time , but I 'll try . '' As I glanced fanatically down at my match , he weaved in and out of traffic to get me to my destination . How long they needed to make it in time to the job interview?	45 minutes	in twenty minutes

3251	0,1	1,0	I am planning on going skiing today so first I need to check my ski gear and make sure all of my equipment is in good working order . Ski boots have buckles on them to close them so I need to check the buckles . After I am done checking the buckles I will need to look at my skis to make sure they are in good condition and do n't have any cracks . Next I will check to make sure I have all of my clothing in order , skiing can be cold and I will want to wear layers .

Next I removed the flat sheet , making sure I pulled the sheet completely off . Finally , I removed the fitted sheet . I decided I wanted to wash the pillow sheets too . Once I pulled off all of the sheets , I placed them in my laundry basket . Just as I was about to start putting on the new sheets I had taken out of my closet ; my dog , Waldo , jumped up on the bed ! Before I could put the new fitted sheet on the bed I had to pick up Waldo and put him on the floor . I made sure all four corners were completely covered . I even pulled the ends of the sheet under the bed , to make sure they would n't come loose ! Next , I took the flat sheet and spread it across my bed . At the foot of my bed I made sure to tuck in the corners of the sheet , so it would n't come off in the night . The only thing left to do was to put the quilt on top ! After that was finished , I made sure everything was neat and tidy and that the quilt was on straight ! Finally I could go to sleep ! When was the fitted sheet on the bed?	Once every 4 weeks	after removing Waldo from the bed

3281	0,1	0,1	The family and I decided it was time to paint a wall in the hallway a new color . We talked about it and everyone suggested their favorite color . After a short conversation we decided on turquoise . We went to the display with the colored squares and found the one that was closest to the color we had picked and handed that square to the person working so she could mix it for us . When we had the paint it was time to get other supplies . We bought a paint roller with a tray and two paint brushes and some tape to keep everything neat . We got in the car and went back home . We used the tape to separate the area to be painted so that the color would not get anywhere we did not want it . Everyone took turns painting the wall . We rested when we were finished to give the paint time to dry . What was everyone going to get to put on the walls?	A new square	paint.

They located the particular charge in their records and told me the name of the entity receiving the payment and their address . I did n't recognize either of these pieces of information but they said that nothing unusual about this transaction took place . I decided to think about this for a couple of days and I did and I realized that the charge was made when we were on vacation and that is why I did n't recognize it . What was checked to make sure everything was correct?	tax notes	the records

3406	0,1	0,1	Last Friday I drove to my beach house excited for a really relaxing weekend at the beach . The weather on Cape Cod had been cool and rainy but the weekend forecast was beautiful and I was ready for really relax . As I drove up to my house I saw that the grass was almost up to the front porch ! The following day I woke up and I went for a quick bike ride and then came home and decided to mow the lawn . My lawn mower was out of gas so I drove to the gas station to get some gas for the lawn mower and I came home and filled it up . The grass was so long that I actually had to mow the lawn a number of times before the lawn was short enough . When I finished the lawn looked great ! After filling what up with gas did they start?

3437	0,1	0,1	This morning I went jogging , like I do every morning . Before I go jogging , I always make sure that I have everything I need , because I hate the idea of coming back to the house before I 'm finished ! I put on my jogging shoes , which are specially designed for jogging , in order to prevent injuries to my feet and ankles . I got a water bottle and stuck it into a backpack that I wear while jogging . The backpack is n't very big , but it 's big enough to hold a water bottle and my phone . I put my phone inside the bag and then I strapped it over my back . Then I went outside and began walking down the road . I walked before I jogged because I wanted to warm myself up . I always follow the same trail around the block when I jog because the road is not busy and it 's safer . Then I went from walking to jogging . I played my music low , but still loud enough to hear . That was when I knew it was time to go back home . I jogged back to my home and went inside . I had finished jogging for the day . What was set to play the favorite jogging list?	A marching band.	The music player, possibly the phone.

3454	0,1	0,1	I 'd just seen a wonderful movie about gardens , and I 'd decided I was going to have a garden , too . So the first thing I did was go to the store and buy some flowers in tiny plastic boxes . It would be easier and faster than growing them from seeds . When I got home from the store , I grabbed a gardening shovel and a tiny rake and went out into the yard with my little boxes of flowers . I dug through the soil in my yard with the shovel , making it loose and soft with the tiny rake , too . Then I grabbed the first flower at the base of the stem , right above where it poked out of the dirt in the plastic box , and pulled it very gently . After a minute , the flower and the dirt popped out of the plastic box . I held the flower and its dirt over the hole and used my fingers to loosen up that dirt , too . Then I set it in the hole I 'd dug for it in the ground and carefully covered it with the rest of the dirt - not too much dirt , though , and I was careful not to pack it tight . After I did the same thing to the other eleven flowers , I went back inside and got a watering can . I filled it up with water from the sink and went back outside , where I poured some water over each flower so it could have a nice drink . I had planted flowers , just like in the movie ! They were on their way to having what?	a nice yard	A garden.

When it beeps , it is perfectly cooked and steaming hot . I smear on a spoonful of pickle relish and a line of mustard , and eat up every bite . The trouble is , this way of cooking a hot dog is not reliable . With some brands of bun , the roll will come out overcooked and spoiled .

There is an underground rail line that runs from nearby my house and takes me directly to the city where I work .

Last time it happened the toilet water filled all the way up to the top of the rim of the bowl . I found the plunger i keep hidden under the sink and started to plung the toilet trying to make the water go down . It was harder than it usually is so I got a bit worried .

3532	0,1	1,0	Just recently , I began to study how to drive a car . After enough time was spent doing this , i asked my dad if he could take me out to drive out on an open road for practice , and he said yes . Once we took the car out to an open , empty road , I tried my best to show him what I 'd learned . I showed him that I knew how to shift gears , use the parking brake , and showed that I was able to make both smooth and sharp turns , along with keeping an eye on things like the speed limit , gas tank reserves , and so on . He seemed to be very impressed with how I did , so he allowed me to get my learner 's permit so that I could legally learn how to drive on the street with other people , as long as he or my mom was in the car with me . What are they just one step closer to getting?	driver's license	a car

3538	0,1	0,1	It was laundry day so I got out the ironing board , the iron , and a fresh load of clothes from the dryer . I had been washing and drying clothes for most of the day so now it was time to catch up on the ironing so that I could get them all put away . I filled the iron with water and turned it on to heat up and set it upright on the ironing board . While the iron was heating I put another load of clothes into the dryer and one into the washing machine . Next I grabbed the first shirt out of the basket of clothes and neatly spread it out on the ironing board . I picked up the iron and moved it over the shirt , sort of slowly , but not slow enough to burn the shirt . After the shirt was flat and there were no more wrinkles I moved it to a different position , where there were more wrinkles , and repeated the same steps . I did this with each piece of clothing until the basket was empty then I put them all away , neatly where they went . I ironed all of the clothes that needed to be ironed until all of the laundry was done , folded , and put away . I usually only iron certain clothes , most people do , mostly dress shirts and khakis and things like that . But , that is basically how you iron clothes !

3542	0,1	1,0	My brother was in court to contest a DUI charge . He asked me to be there to support him , so I agreed to go to the hearing . Before I left the house , I made sure I was wearing clean , presentable clothing . I entered the court house and was instructed to walk through a metal detector and security pat-down area . I walked through the metal detector and did not beep . A security guard gave me a pat down to check for any suspicious items . He said I was cleared to walk inside . I found the room and asked the guard at the door if I could enter . He said yes and told me that I had to be quiet and sit in one of the pew seats . I walked inside , looked at my brother who was sitting at a table near the front with his lawyer , and sat down as close as I could . He gave his testimony and his lawyer asked him questions .

3548	0,1	0,1	I love cherries . I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one . They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . When the hole was all filled up I stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil . When I was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose . I turned on the water and slowly watered the tree . When all the water had sunk into the ground , I put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing . I knew that I would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established . The tree will get bigger every year , and I 'm looking forward to the day when I 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard ! what did they buy	cherries	cherry tree

3550	0,1	0,1	I love cherries . I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one . They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . When the hole was all filled up I stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil . When I was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose . I turned on the water and slowly watered the tree . When all the water had sunk into the ground , I put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing . I knew that I would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established . The tree will get bigger every year , and I 'm looking forward to the day when I 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard ! where was it loaded	backyard	pick up truck

3557	0,1	0,1	I asked my family what they wanted to eat for dinner and they said spaghetti with meat sauce . I got the ground beef out of the refrigerator and placed it in a pan on the stove . While my daughter did her homework , I fried the meat on medium heat while breaking it into smaller pieces at the same time . Once the meat was no longer pink I turned off the stove and drained the grease by spooning the excess fat into a jar . I like my family to be as healthy as possible when we eat . Once the grease was removed I added the sauce to the meat and mixed it together over low heat . I let it keep cooking until it began to slowly bubble and my family could smell the delicious sauce .

3562	0,1	1,0	Last Christmas I had to bake a cake for myself , and it was a bit of a doozy . I do n't know a lot about making cakes , but I have a super-huge baking pan , an oven , and a big sweet tooth ! I left the house looking around various convenience stores for cake mix ; it was Christmas , so going to a big store and wasting a bunch of time was out of the question . I finally settled on two boxes of butter cake mix and some pink lemonade frosting and took it all home . Since my pan was way too big for just one box , I had to follow the instructions and double every ingredient while making the batter and pouring it in . I preheated the oven , put the cake pan with the batter in to bake , and watched TV for a few hours while I waited for it to be done . Once it was done , I took it out to cool and frosted it , and then cut the cake into several square pieces . It went better than I expected for my first cake on short notice , but the frosting was SUPER sweet ! What did they want to make sure was fully baked?	the cake.	the christmas casserole.

3590	0,1	0,1	One day , I was hungry at home and I decided that I wanted something healthy . I looked in my fridge and found a bag of lettuce , as well as some tomatoes , carrots , red onions , and salad dressing . I wanted to make enough for more than one meal . After making sure all the food was still fresh by checking for any places where the food was too mushy or the wrong color , I found a plastic bowl with a lid in the cupboard that was big enough for about three meals . Then , I washed off all the vegetables and set them in the bowl for the moment . I cut up the tomatoes and the onions , and sliced the carrots into little slivers , making little piles of each vegetable in different parts of the board . After that , I dumped the lettuce into the bowl , then carefully slid the vegetables into the bowl , making sure not to get any on the counter or the floor . Finally , I poured in a few teaspoons of salad dressing , closed the lid on the bowl , shook it up to make sure the salad dressing spread out , and opened up the bowl again . I used tongs to put the salad into a different bowl I was going to eat out of , and put the lid back onto the big bowl and put that in the fridge . When did they get out the cutting board?	before deciding person was hungry	before cutting vegetables

3594	0,1	0,1	We had finally moved into our new house . After years of living in apartments where we were not allowed to pain the walls , we had bought a house . That meant that I could paint the walls any color I wanted . We decided to start in the living room . We began by taping off the window sills and light switches that we did not want to get any paint on . After we were done with that we got our rollers and mixed the paint . My husband poured some paint for me and handed me a roller . I painted the large areas of the wall with the roller , being sure to go in many different directions . My husband was working a little bit ahead of me to get the areas around where we had taped off with a small brush . How soon did they have the whole wall painted?
